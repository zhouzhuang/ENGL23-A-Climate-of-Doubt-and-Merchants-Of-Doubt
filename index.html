When asked what would happen if the climate skeptics were wrong, Myron Ebell’s response was only “I would be sorry”. Are you kidding me? When millions of people have to be relocated because their homes are no longer habitable, when the 3 billion people on earth who rely on fish for their primary food source starve, and billions of species go extinct -- I think it’s going to be a little too late for an apology. This documentary infuriated me and left me completely hopeless. I can only imagine how a scientist who spent their life proving anthropogenic climate change must feel when their studies aren't represented in the policies because of corruption from big oil companies.
<br><br>

I thought that Bob Ingils put the climate debate best.
<br><br>

He said: “Your child is sick, you take him to the doctor, if 98 doctors tell you to do one thing, and two tell you to do the other, are you going to listen to the two?” Well, of course you shouldn’t listen to the two. But when those two doctors bribe you into taking their side, maybe it skews your decision on how you would normally treat your child. 
<br><br>

I think that politicians who deny climate change need to be locked up in jail. I know that sounds extreme, but the policies that they are promoting are destroying our ecosystem and ruining any chance that we have at salvaging a habitable planet. Millions of people are going to starve if we don’t see an abrupt and radical change in policy now. Millions of people are going to lose their homes as a result of this, and we’re already seeing this happening! Just this last month thousands of homes in Australia burned during the brush fires.
<br><br>

I can see why people are apprehensive to policies that limit fossil fuel consumption. The oil industry is an essential part of our economy, but switching to renewables would create new jobs and foster economic prosperity. Moreover, switching to renewable energy is an inevitable part of our future. One day, politicians on every side of the political debate will see that there is no more time to debate and will see that fossil fuels are completely destroying our planet. I just hope that is before the tipping point, where we will be unable to act and fix anything. The climate change skeptics only prolong the period before we inevitably switch to renewables, but this is undoubtedly destroying our ecosystem.

I agree so much with what you said. I had the same reaction to that empty "sorry". How can their sorry’s answer their grandchildren’s pleas for clean air, less hurricanes, less fires, and a more hopeful future? Also, I liked Ingils analogy as well. I think it was very well put and it was nice to see from a conservative POV. I agree with pretty much everything you said and while I've already made my comment for this video, I just wanted to emphasize that you put it very well. ^

I completely agree with you Jessica. This documentary was not only frustrating but truly demeaning. In scenarios specifically relating to climate change, it is crucial that those that have the power to make actual changes do so. Their actions would help many people for generations to come, but politicians focus on playing the game that is politics. What was shocking to me was that some politicians were openly discussing the need for a carbon tax and other ways to combat the growing issue of climate change, but once they were elected they removed all evidence of them supporting such a thing. Politicians that do such a thing in my opinion are not doing their jobs. They are meant to produce policies and laws that protect the people, not screw us over in the future. Their worries to be re elected and keep the people happy triumph the change that needs to occur. It is already too late for an apology from lawmakers. Unless we put people in power that will do what needs to be done (not to appease the people but because they believe it has to be done, we are not going to create the change we need to see. That is the change that we need to see in who we elect. Something I did not think about before Jessica’s comment was how the scientists who are clearly proving that climate change is not only happening but caused by human actions feel when they see the way their data is being reacted to. I can't even imagine the pain that they must feel. I genuinely feel remorse for the scientists who are just trying to warn people about climate change. The negative way that they are regarded is heartbreaking. People will go to extreme limits to drag those that endorse climate change.  The way that Bob Inglis addressed the science behind climate change also really stood out to me. It is exactly like having ninety eight doctors tell you one thing and two tell you another. There is no better way to put it, which makes complete sense when you remove climate change out of the equation. This only adds more shock to the people in the documentary who are still denying the proof that is right in front of their faces with the science. I really admire people like Bob Inglis who don't play the game that is politics and do what they know is right. Even though he wasn't reelected he did not pretend that climate change is not a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. I, like Jessica, can understand the apprehension of those that are afraid of the economic change that will occur with a carbon tax and other laws protecting the climate from continuing to change. However, there is no other option left. We are in such a bad position environmentally that we must adapt to this change and make sure that the changes have a positive influence.
<br><Hr>
I completely agree. I found it laughable that the republican senators believed in their own "common sense" more than the scientific consensus. As if a politician with no background in science has a valid opinion compared to scientists who devoted their lives to addressing and researching this issue. This is why I hate the phrase "it's just my opinion". Everyone is "entitled" to their own opinion but at the point where they have absolutely no ground from which to base this opinion, you would hope that they'd reconsider. Ironically enough, a large amount of these red states are in the south and will likely see very dramatic climatic impacts in the coming years and will be forced to bite their tongue in fear of losing support. It is sad to think that just 8 years ago we could've had a united movement to stop this from getting out of hand but now the denial movement is only gaining momentum. Although it is pretty obvious, I had never considered real estate as a major sector that would have a vested interest in climate denialism. They want to cast doubt upon any articles regarding sea level rise because it decreases their house values and therefore makes them lose profit. If only we lived in a world where people could set aside their own selfish interests and actually consider reality. And unfortunately, the people with the most to lose, also have the most power.
<br><Hr>

I agree with you completely, this film also left me distraught and furious with the blatant ignorance that some people have in this world. I think your point on locking up those in jail who actively disagree with climate change is valid because they are helping single handedly hurt our planet every day. Not only are they removing or blocking bills that should be passed to help combat climate change, but they are also receiving large sums of money from huge fossil fuel companies. Do their constituents not see the blatant ignorance and selfishness that comes from someone who is supposed to make our world better and advocate for policies to do just that? These politicians and fossil fuel companies are damaging our planet and the millions of ecosystems that Earth holds. 
<br><br>

 I’m also very angry with how the issue of climate change has been created to be a partisan issue. Climate change is NOT a partisan issue, it is bipartisan and every single person on this planet should care and do their part in fixing what has already been done. Its frustrating that it has become a political issue between the left and the right. This issue spreads across every person, animal, and forest, etc. with no care for if you are republican or democrat. We need to change the minds of the people who think that this is a partisan issue in order to reach more people in order to change their opinion on climate change and what we need to do to fix it. I am fearful for our future. The people in this video scare me, and I know that there are probably many more of the same people. We need to do something to change the minds of the people and work together to help our planet.

I completely agree with you. When I watched A Climate of Doubt, I found it shocking that Myron Ebell holds such an irresponsible attitudes towards climate crisis, which influences millions of lives of human, animals, and plants. He said that if he’s wrong, he will feel sorry. That’s absolutely non-sense. When he spreads the skepticism about climate change, supported and funded by fossil fuel companies, he just ignores people who lost their houses because of wildfire and people who got sick because of droughts, not to mention the rising sea-level, the melting iceberg, or the endangered animals. He and many other skeptics manage to propagate the ridiculous ideas such as earth’s temperature is getting cooler and CO2 discharged by human has no influence on the atmosphere. Even thousands of people are suffering from the anthropogenic climate change, these skeptics wouldn’t stop their fraud because the fossil fuel industries are behind them, providing money. 
<br><br>

    In the film, I learned that various kinds of scientists and politicians constitutes the team of skilled messengers and contrarians which tries to make the skepticism become a routine part of public discussion. Thees people utilize numerous approaches, including holding huge conference, using medias, personalizing attacks, putting banner on hot air balloons, making authentic-looking document, and slandering scientists. When they tried to persuade citizens, they indicated that cap-and-trade system brings higher taxes, less jobs, and less freedom. They create the hoax both politically and scientifically, successfully sow the seeds of doubts in citizens’ mind. Since many people don’t have the chance to get higher education about climate change, they are rather easily to be swayed by the skeptics. I also feel angry that many states enact bills that hinder people’s action to protect the environment and further increase the climate skepticism. I really hope that we can get rid of the capital influence of fossil fuel industries and win this fight before it’s too late.

The statement about climate change deniers being locked up is taking the issue a bit too far. It is obviously wrong to spread misinformation, especially from a powerful position, but it is a civil liberty to speak -- this would only lead to a number of supreme court cases debating the limitations on free speech. However, I do understand the emotional sentiment, this is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with.
<br><br>

One of the major reasons that certain conservative politicians spread misinformation is to gain political capital. Their votes are a type of currency, they know they can continue to gain traction by appealing to the masses that don't believe in climate change -- so they target this group. It stems from malicious intent but it is an effective action for attracting attention and support. 
<br><br>

The philosopher Kuhn coined the concept of the "paradigm shift". A paradigm is a foundational aspect to a certain field of science, in this case it is climate denial. The further one's beliefs are from the current paradigm, the harder it is to switch over. People will ignore evidence that contradicts their beliefs. It is not until we gain enough support from the country/world that a paradigm shift will occur. As of now, it is almost strictly a bipartisan issue.
<br><Hr>
I resonated with almost everything you stated. The anti-climate change arguments made in this film were baseless, bias, and ridiculous. The fact that Christopher Monkton, an anti-climate change heavyweight who has no scientific qualifications, is so highly regarded within his community of contrarians makes absolutely no sense to me. Fred Singer didn't even believe in the connections between smoking and health. These people which so many regard as scientifically sound and trustworthy, are not credible sources. Even members of congress are keeping their mouths shut on climate topics in fear of backlash. How and why contrarians and policymakers refuse to see the evidence right in front of them I will never understand, but they are now doing it at the peril of our planet. Even the National Academy of Science's report says, "climate change is occurring, and is largely caused by human activities and poses a significant risk for a broad range of human and natural systems," yet there are still hundreds of people out there still in denial. Their weak attempts at deflection such as emission reduction being a cover for reducing freedom, are pathetic and sad last ditch efforts to sway the general public in their favor. Saying we must have the "courage to do nothing" is not only absurd, but dangerous. The only thing I didn't agree with you on was in feeling completely hopeless after watching this film. If anything it gave me hope to know that 97% of scientists are on the planet's side and that much of the anti-climate change "research" is being disproved by real scientists.

<br><Hr>
I agree with everything that you said. I really enjoyed this comment because I was able to feel her anger and frustration just by reading this. I too am became infuriated after watching this film. I think what is most frustrating is the fact that these rich, old, white men act like they actually care about the wellbeing of this planet but I know for a fact the only thing that they care about is money. That is why their opinions are so screwed. These huge oil companies that are worth billions are just throwing money at them and are telling them what to think and they just go along with it because all they see are dollar signs. Why would they care about the planet anyway? They have already lived there lives on this planet. They do not need to think about the future of this planet because they won't even be here to see it. We will be here.

When Inglis said that he would listen to the two doctors, I almost fell out of my seat laughing. Now, I am in no way saying that this is not a serious issue nor am I implying that climate change is a laughable topic. I just love that use of logic. And I completely agree with you when you use the idea that those two doctors are bribing Inglis, so he is definitely going to take their advice. Just to preface, I do not believe that either side is ignoring bribes and I have firm faith that both the left and right wing are having money be put into their mouth.
<br><br>


However, I think there is a time for opinion and there is a time for action. I love how Ken brings up the idea that our climate is causing people to flee their homes, and the premise of environmental refugees is distinctly that. The 3% of scientists who side with the special interest groups that continue to deny the existence of climate change are holding more than 3% of the representatives that craft the policies of tomorrow. It has continued to cause inaction within our government, and it is largely due to the way our government works. Whether people want to admit it or not, the policies that reach the public is largely based on the party that is the majority within the branches. As of today, the right-wing holds the senate and the white house. The policies and legislation that is being passed clearly reflects their ideologies. But. it causes inaction when both sides can look at the same thing and gain two different interpretations. Climate change is no different. There is much to lose economically with combating climate change that conservatives refuse to give up, but that has caused the lack of legislation. We need to think about future generations and understand that our government does not shape our today, but our tomorrow. No groundwork has been laid out for us, and that must end.
<br><Hr>
I agree completely with your statement. It was infuriating watching how the fossil fuel industry has basically brainwashed so much of the US. It's angering that they will heartlessly continue to jeopardize the health of the planet and all life on it for their own monetary gain. It is also shocking to see how they are not being punished for this heinous act, they face no real consequences from bribing people and discrediting the works of many scientists. The income of a few major oil companies versus the overall habitability of the earth should not be such large of a debate. 
<br><br>
This film also reminds me of Wednesday's lecture when a comment stated that disasters don't discriminate. When they stated that in 25 years there would be a 39-inch sea-level rise in North Carolina, and the deniers and skeptics just stated it was a threat so companies could make money from renovating the coast. The majority of people disregarded the warning, but the sea level rise is inevitable. Again, disasters don't discriminate, so will they change their mentalities when they see they coastal communities being engulfed by the ocean, or would they find another thing to blame it on?

<br><Hr>
I agree, what an understatement. I found it amazing that there is an actual coalition of people that are spreading lies and biases about an issue that has already affected us harshly for a decade. The fact that oil and fracking companies are behind anti-climate change associations funding demonstrates that climate change has become more of a campaigning issue than anything. Oil companies fund anti-climate change groups to campaign against climate change because they are afraid to lose money. To reduce the hazards of climate change, humanity as a whole would have to stop burning fossil fuels or pay carbon taxes, which will significantly negatively impact the demand for greenhouse emitting substances such as gasoline which oil companies provide. Because of denial and wanting to avoid the burden of changing their luxurious lifestyles, people attend those campaigning events and come out thinking climate change is a hoax. It's a vicious process we must stop if we want to reduce the impacts of climate change.

<br><br>

This documentary also opened my eyes to how susceptible people are to money. Like Jessica mentions, if 98 doctors tell you to do something, you will most likely believe them over 2 other doctors telling you to do the contrary. However, given a bribe and reasonably structured arguments, you might be compelled to listen to the 2 doctors and take their advice. I believe that the climate change crisis isn't really one about the ecosystem or how we have affected it but rather over money. If oil companies' revenue was not entirely based on fossil fuels, I'm certain that they would only have minor issues in changing their lifestyles to protect our planet. Rather than doing that, however, they fund anti-alarmist organizations in order to convince the general public that climate change is not very important. That way, average Americans continue to purchase gasoline in exchange for the money the oil companies want. 
<br><br>


Corporations are just too greedy altogether. They want to keep expanding in property and power but don't take into account how much they are damaging the environment. It's imperative that we expose this damage now as we will be responsible to clean up any mess they leave behind in the future.

<br><Hr>

I agree with your comment, I too found myself feeling frustrated and hopeless when watching this documentary. Even if this film was made a few years ago, the issue has only gotten worse and the skeptics continue to deny it. Bob Inglis also caught my attention, and the issue of scientific malpractice infuriates me. I can’t believe that people who deem themselves educated and professional would allow themselves to be bribed and support something they perhaps don’t believe. I don’t know about others, but if there is something that I can’t understand or do not support, I would not be able to sleep at night. I just feel like I’m doing something wrong and that my actions are hurting others. A statement about skeptics that caught my attention is one that describes them, “They think of themselves as rebels, going up against the biggest players in science, government, and the media”. I jumped when I heard this. How are people going to think of themselves as revolutionary and as if they are doing something to help the world, when in reality their skepticism is not going to allow a future world to exist? These same people claim that the planet’s climate will naturally change no matter what we do. Even if that were true, our actions have been damaging to climate and climate patterns. It is no surprise that we are having longer summers and in turn, longer wildfire seasons with even stronger fires. This is a continuous cycle that is becoming difficult to control and stop, which is why we must act upon our knowledge and stop ignoring it, in hope of it just going away. I also agree with your argument on the positives behind switching to renewable energy. As you mention, it will create more jobs and is healthier for our planet, two factors often overlooked by both politicians and common Americans. Politicians must put their beliefs aside and realize that the climate crisis is also a national security issue, which will affect every American (and everyone else on the planet), not just one party or another. As touched on in the film, nature dictates what will happen, and we are only fueling it to generate even stronger catastrophes. This focus on the ocean made me think back to the film “Before the Flood” when someone stated, “The ocean is not republican or democrat. The only thing the ocean knows how to do is rise”. Politicians and lawmakers must realize that these vulnerabilities and dangers don’t go away simply because they are being ignored. If anything, the consequences will be harsher if we continue to wait and push the issue to the side.

<br><Hr>
I agree with you. Green practices will take over the economy and eventually the government. 
<br><br>
In the film, I felt the most powerful phrase used to describe the clime crisis is "an inconvenient truth". It's terribly inconvenient! But it's the truth. Another small-scale inconvenient truth is finding out you have a cavity. You are upset by the news, and you want to delay getting it fixed because it takes a lot of time, money, and effort! However, it's the truth and you have no choice but to fill it or your entire mouth will decay. Soon enough, the world will decide to take care of the climate crisis. Right now it's just delaying treatment. 
<br><br>

When Christopher Monckton started talking, I felt so bad for him. 
<br><br>
"The right response to the non-problem of global warming is to have the courage to do nothing," he said. 
<br><br>
I feel bad for a lot of old people simply because they're old but I especially feel bad for Monckton because he's so old yet still so ignorant (and he looks like a guppy fish).
<br><br>

I especially felt bad when one man said "the left marches out and does whatever they're told too" and another said "we have an army now too". Meanwhile, clips of this so-called "army" are shown. It's a bunch of very old people. It's as though he's painting a battle between the old and young people. I thought to myself "someone should let this guy know he's part of a dying army."
<br><br>

My favorite part of the entire film was when I watched Bob Inglis, a religious conservative, defend climate change! It was absolutely refreshing to see a politician NOT conform to partisan norms.

<br><hr>

thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! I was beyond shocked and was in utter disbelief when I was watching that segment. Those climate change deniers and skeptics are really selfish human beings that the only one goal they have in mind is money, and all they want to do is to reap as many profits from the earth and our environment as they can even at a price of destructing and damaging irreversibly the very environment that we along with countless other species depend upon for survival at a rapid pace that is well beyond that of the environment's own self-repair. Those politicians are irresponsible in their actions and speeches that they have completely lost the moral good since they are willing to trade the safety and prosperity of the planet and its ecosystem for the mere hundreds of thousands of dollars provided by the fossil fuel companies. 
<br><br>
I also like how you mentioned the example Bob Inglis gave in regards to climate change because it is a very simple yet true example and it accurately reflects the popular beliefs and opinions towards the climate crisis that we as a society are deviating from the path that we should be taking, which is to pass laws and legislation to restrict carbon emission into the atmosphere and extraction of fossil fuels underground, and we are walking on a dangerous path that will lead us into an ominous, devastating future, which is blatantly ignoring the scientific research studies and evidence proving the legitimacy and harm of climate change and delaying our actions and responses to this environmental crisis. What goes around comes around, and we will eventually taste the consequences of our own behaviors if no immediate action is taken to address the issue now.

<br><Hr>
While I share your about this intricate disinformation campaign put on by fossil fuel interests, I do not agree that we should incarcerate these deniers. The right that those people have to free speech is the same right we need to criticize our government and make climate change a top priority; to impose punishment for that sets a precedent for those in power to incarcerate anyone who disagrees with them, which can easily be consequential for us as well. 
<br><br>

Inglis' analogy was spot on and incredibly effective in pointing out the ridiculousness of the climate change deniers' arguments. The misinformation campaign against climate science is honestly very scary because of human nature: people tend to hear what they want to hear, and when people don't think critically, it's very easy to indoctrinate them into a different ideology. Once you get enough people to believe a certain thing and rally behind it, it's so easy for others to get on board and to forget the truth.
<br><br>

And what surprised me the most was that this truth, climate science, was widely accepted by politicians from both sides of the aisle: John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich all professed urgency at the climate issue back in 2008. 
<br><br>

But fossil fuel interests are so strong. I'm honestly not surprised though - when Ken talks about the 88% of coal reserves, on which the fossil fuel industry is very economically dependent, it makes sense why those companies would be opposed to climate science that threatens their longevity. That's why I think policymakers should focus on finding viable alternatives for those companies (instead of primarily pointing blame) so they don't have to come up with all this misinformation.
<br><Hr>
 I enjoyed your insight, and completely agree that incarcerating politicians who deny climate change is an infringement on our right to free speech, and I completely overlooked that aspect in my comment. 

<br><br>

I still believe that the policies that climate change deniers enact and promote lead to devastating consequences: destruction of our planet's ecosystem, loss of habitat for many species on earth, increase in the amount of catastrophic natural disasters, and ultimately the devastating loss of human life that is a byproduct of inaction from our government. 

<br><br>

I see climate change denial as incredibly insensitive. Not does it attempt to discredit the work of thousands upon thousands of scientists, but it turns a blind eye to the millions of people who have already been affected by climate change (those affected by the horrifically increasing natural disasters in the past few years) and who are likely to see the consequences of it in the near future (those who will suffer from forced migration, lack of food, etc). I see the denial of climate change as completely irresponsible and selfish, considering that many of those who deny climate are affluent enough to protect themselves from any dangers that climate change poses.

<br><Hr>
The fact that Ebell's response is only that he would be sorry is horrific. Even the terrible effects you listed are nowhere near the extent that it would truly be, and he would just be sorry? It is truly heartless to see some people act like this. It just proves to me how cruel and corrupt our world can be, even on something as global of a threat as climate change. If aliens attacked our world and we were told that we were going to become extinct because of them, why would you trust people who make a ton of money off of the aliens? I know that metaphor is stupid, but we are facing a global threat that, if it continues, will cause our extinction, and there are people trusting people who are making millions/billions off of it.
<br><br>


The Ingils quote is a great one, and it really puts the climate change denial in perspective. It really does not make sense. It is crazy how corrupt our world is, and what people will do for money. While I don't necessarily agree that these politicians should be locked up, I just think they should not be given a platform for their dumb ideas. However, the fact that they are misleading the public and avidly trying to continue climate change which will harm the human race could be considered criminal, and I would not be surprised if there is legal action against some of these people if climate change continues down the path it is on.
<br><br>


A Climate of Doubt was hard to watch. Seeing support for ending climate change go down is not something I thought had happened, yet clearly there was a huge difference in 2008 vs. 2012. I can only hope that the exponential growth of those who think climate change is a huge problem continues until we are able to act as a unit, which is the only way we will be able to end climate change and save our planet.
<br><Hr>
Frustrating doesn't even begin to express the vast range of emotions that I felt while watching this documentary. It was so incredibly disheartening to see how hundreds of thousands of climate scientists had their life's work attacked by a misinformation and maliciously framed statistics. In American politics, climate change is brought up as a bipartisan issue. Organizations against American policy on climate change center their campaigns on the idea of protecting AMERICA from "false science". This stuck out to me because climate change is not an AMERICAN issue. It's a WORLDWIDE issue, and literally every single person on this Earth will be affected by the consequences of climate change. The fact that these lobbying organizations and evil institutions are trying to frame these issues as a bipartisan and unresolved issue is completely erroneous.
<br><br>

I hope that your optimism is carries throughout the rest of the world. Renewables shouldn't be the "future". They should be our present. They should have been our past. There is no time to act other than now. It's not only destroying our ecosystem. It's destroying our livelihood. It's destroying the entire planet as we know it. The power to start change rests in not the hands of the politicians but in the hands of everybody and everything living on this planet. If we want to protect the future of civilization, we must attack anthropogenic climate change now.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you that the policies on climate issue require a change. But there are some problems with this. I do not know a lot about US gov but I think the Republicans right now are like pro-economy and Democrats are like pro-ecosystem. Personally, I think there is no consensus among the house and senate as they are politically divided. To resolve the conflict they need to find a common goal on this issue. Like they can build more nuclear power fields in some abandoned areas to reduce the needs of fossil fuel electricity, which also helps the study of the nuclear weapon which promotes national security. 
<br><br>


The way how fossil fuel business and government are linked is also ridiculous. While many of the climate deniers receiving billions of dollars from the fossil fuel companies, they keep framing climate scientists just want to get funded. They assume people are dumb and they can easily manipulate them. But I am pretty sure their arrogance will make them lose the match eventually.
<br><Hr>

Your thought process was very well transcribed and received entirely. I greatly appreciated reading your analogy of listening to two or three doctors instead of 98 other ones, similar to how some people are still listening to the ~3% of scientists denying climate change, it really puts it into perspective for how ridiculous it is. Unless there was something personal on the line, what reason would any government, person, or group of people have for denying the opinion of 98 professionals instead of 2. Ridiculous. If we don't implement laws on fossil fuel consumption, when will we? People getting upset over it is completely upside down. "Lucky" they are even allowed to burn any at all. Imagine someone finding their ignorant, teenage, pleasure-motivated child, smoking cigarettes. A pack a day. They are burning a substance for personal pleasure, at the cost of the quality and health of the community at home. "Okay, now you can only smoke half a pack a day." What? What kind of parenting is that? No smoking of any kind at all whatsoever anymore. Learn to adapt to not having them. Not as easily done in terms of public policy on fossil fuel consumption but a similar idea. Rather than focusing on this massive dependence on fossil fuels, recognize they are going to kill the planet, and put burning them out of mind as a possible option. In the same way a smoker learns to adapt to a life without tobacco, because they know it's not arguable that it's just straight up polluting their body, we can adapt to finding another source of income/pleasure. One not so deadly.

<br><Hr>
I also liked the way Bob Ingil made that statement, it was a strong attempt to make the public see deniers faults. With 97% of scientist agreeing on climate change and only 3% not, why is there even any deniers. Then again through out events of history we are very aware of how easy it is to make the people believe the unbelievable. 

<br><br>

What I also found interesting was the way deniers presented their evidence. "There's been no temperature increase in the last 15 years."  When I heard that I thought to myself "Well 15 years is not that great amount of time when looking at the beginning of industrialization or just of generations before us, 15 years is such a small window in the timeline." Then I was presented with what I believe is the truth, which is that deniers focus on these small portions of time because you can find a pattern of decreasing temperature. But if you look at the whole graph, all the patterns are actually increasing. Just goes to show how it is possible to sway the evidence and that is how you get people to believe the lies.
<br><Hr>
I was also incredibly frustrated while watching the documentary. The older generation's climate deniers genuinely believe that "I would be sorry" is all they have to say for the situation. That part really cemented for me the fact that these people just don't care anymore. They're not going to be alive long enough for the consequences of their actions to bite them and will continue to endorse and perform harmful acts to the planet. Seeing the extent to which money drives the climate change debate is frankly, disheartening. Leaders of our nation are being paid to lie to our faces. We are destroying ecosystems and nonhuman life because of the sheer amount of misinformation that's being spread. I mentioned this in a previous comment, but it angers me to think that all of this preventative effort is just to line the pockets of a wealthy few. I can also understand that people might be doubtful about fossil fuel limiting policies. The carbon tax, although in the long run are beneficial to reducing taxes (hey, don't conservatives want that?), would create a more immediate hurdle for current, everyday living.
<br><Hr>
I totally agree with everything you said.  The example you used about believing 98 doctors who say one thing or 2 who say another is completely relevant.  There’s a reason such a large amount of scientists believe in (and have found evidence of) climate change, anyone looking for the other 2% are just looking for reasons to validate their lazy and in denial lifestyle.  Yes, of course many people are going to want to believe that it isn’t happening, it’s in our nature to look for the answer that is least burdening. But that doesn’t mean it’s the right answer.  People can go out and read or watch all you want about climate change not being real but while they do that it’s happening right before their eyes and in real time.  I agree it may at first be economically difficult to implement new laws and such a different “lifestyle” onto everyone but what I don’t understand is why politicians don’t figure out new laws and such now while we still (kind of) have time.  What’s going to happen when the world’s basically ending and everyone’s stuck scrambling to reverse what has already been done?
<br><Hr>
I completely agree with everything that you said in your post. Sustainability and switching to renewable energy is being prolonged because of these climate change skeptics that manipulate scientific data. Towards the beginning of the film when they showed a chart of the escalation of temperature during the past several decades, it shocked me to see how much people can skew data. For example, it showed how politicians and skeptic took pieces of the chart to show how temperature fluctuate and has no upward trend in temperature. A lot of conservatives are hesitant to comment or state their opinions about climate change because they are endorsed by these major fossil fuel corporations. This film showed me how easy it is for the media to change the publics view even though there is a lot of factual scientific data about the negative consequences of climate change. I think it is the case for a lot of politicians and big corporations to choose what they want to believe and ignore all opposing evidence. It made me frustrated to see this film because it proved that at the end of the day people are going to believe what they want and sometimes there is not a way to change their minds. I think it is important that our generation really steps up and educates future generations to act upon the climate crisis so that we are not stuck in the same cycle of ignorance.

This was EXACTLY the comments I was going to rant about, but seeing yours already made and pinned by the channel leads me to simply add on as a response.
<br><br>

I watched “A Climate of Doubt.” I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that Myron Ebell’s would only offer an apology as a result of the legislation he advocates for. By that time, what would be left of us? It was really disheartening to watch this documentary unfold because it’s the truth that individuals completely believe this climate crisis is a hoax when we literally live, experiencing the changes to our earth. And for what? For these fossil fuel companies to succeed. I feel awful for the politician Bob Inglis who was practically disposed of for believing in anthropogenic climate change. As you pointed out, his comparison to listening to the majority of doctors raising concerns would be reasonable. It is so pathetically sad that for the sake of profit, those in power are willing to destroy our ecosystem.
<br><br>

Moreover, the notion that scientists are overexaggerating the climate crisis is a large part. I think people tend to lean on this idea because they want to be ignorant. They don’t want policy changes for their convenience and would rather label climate change as a hoax or as a future problem or something unexplainable than make efforts in their own life. This topic should not be taboo to the government, to the president or to Congress! This is where they need to step up the most. The most evidence to prove there has been no global warming would not be actual evidence of that, but the email scandal. Even if that didn’t happen, climate change would still be disregarded and attempted to be taken down. It is so frustrating that people don’t wake up and stop claiming it gets a little cold or a little warm when there’s glaciers melting and wildfires starting right next to them. I admit a carbon tax is scary to implement to the lower and middle class and I would rather attack fossil fuel corporations, but this is a separate discussion that can happen after we get more on board and accepting of their responsibility.

<br><Hr>
Definitely agree with much of what you said here! While watching the Climate of Doubt, all I could think about was the fact that there are politicians out there challenging the works of those outside their field are ridiculous. Your example of Bob Inglis illustrates that well. With about 98% of scientists all agreeing on the idea of global warming, I found it hysterical that there are those that believe otherwise. On top of that, many of these nay-sayers are not even scientists. These politicians are simply airing on the side against climate change simply to promote big business such as the fossil fuel industry. Their short sightedness is simply infuriating. They fail to see that the loss of the fossil fuel industry will create a new economy within the renewable energy fields. I noticed, therefore, that many of the politicians we see in these films and readings are reactive rather than proactive. I believe in these politicians minds they really do believe in climate change but simply cannot state that due to political and business ties. They believe that since climate change has not drastically affected us yet, that they will figure out the solution when it arrives rather than preventing climate change from happening all together. I surely will not be surprised to see these same politicians in the future talking about ways we can save ourselves from climate change, as they will do whatever they can to gain votes and public support. I only hope that it is not too late before they realize they were wrong.

<br><Hr>
Unfortunately you can't lock politicians up in jail for spreading harmful information that they claim to believe in, even if they don't and are only saying so to support outside interests. This is part of the darker side of the freedom of speech. There is something to be said about finding a fine line between spreading a naive belief and spreading dangerous misinformation with the intention of preventing safety regulations. Laws against misinformation and hate speech are a slippery slope and are extremely difficult to pass, probably almost impossible in the U.S.
<br><br>
Those who are apprehensive to policies advocating for a switch to renewables because they say it'll destroy the economy is just another lie. Just like the tobacco companies, they know climate change is a threat and don't care. They also know that the economy will be completely fine if there's a switch, but they lie again, saying that their companies are too important to move away from. The only economy they care about protecting is their personal wealth. Every move they make is targeted towards financial self-preservation, and nothing is off the table when it comes to protecting that. When you think about it, expecting the entire industry to sacrifice themselves for the greater good is a hefty request. If you worked hard for your wealth and made it to a certain point, you'd probably rationalize anything to avoid giving it all up for some people you don't even know, even if it means denying hard facts.
<br><Hr>
 you have put my thoughts into words. Under your comments, I am pleased that we all agree with your points. In the documentary, A Climate Of Doubt, climate change supporters and deniers are all taking their stance. The debate on climate change has been going on for decades. Arguments will never stop. I understand that there will always be people who are unwilling to accept the fact that climate change is anthropogenic. Nonetheless, I still found it disturbing that the deniers like Myron Ebell do not care about the disastrous consequences of climate change. 
<br><br>

We should never give up on our opinion. Although the current politicians are reluctant to accept this fact, we can still do our parts by voting and eliminating waste. We must stop this meaningless debate and act. I hope that we are still able to save our planet from climate change.

<br><Hr>

I 100% agree with everything you said in your response- especially the comment about throwing politicians who don’t believe in climate change in jail. Politicians are supposed to represent the wants and needs of their constituents and not the wants and needs of big power player companies who deny climate change in order to keep turning profits. By continuing to deny climate change, they deny the right for people of the United States to be properly heard and represented which is the biggest injustice in itself. If we were able to throw away the politicians who didn’t serve with the best interest in mind for the planet and replace them with people who share genuine ideas about preventing climate change, we would be able to start to clean up this giant mess. I also agree that switching to renewable energy resources may cause a disruption in the economy, but in the long run will become just as prosperous and wealthy as the big dominating fossil fuel companies that continue to wreak havoc to this day.

<br><Hr>

I agree with you and when I heard his response of “sorry” to the questions “what if skeptics are wrong?”, I immediately got mad. People lost their home and even family members because of climate change. Can “sorry” bring them back or prevent more people from suffering from the same issue? The answer is absolutely “no”. Deniers deny the fact that climate change is happening and harmful because they have not suffered from this issue while other people have been suffering, and their standpoints on this issue simply shows how selfish they are. I wish they’re right about this issue because if that is the case, less people will suffer. But, what if they’re wrong? Who should be responsible for the loss? The answer is nobody can, because there is something that can never be brought back if it’s gone.

<br><Hr>

I felt the frustration in this comment a lot. It is absolutely infuriating to know that our policymakers can be bought out by fossil fuel interests and have no accountability for it whatsoever. It truly is disheartening to watch a film like "Climate of Doubt." I already knew how much interference there has been on behalf of the fossil fuel industry on delaying climate action and politicizing the issue, but to see the film and put a face on to the group of people who are worsening the issue makes me even more pissed off. Something that particularly stuck out to me was when the polarization of the issue happened and the circumstances behind it. The rise of the tea party and economic uncertainty in 2008 made people--especially the working-class folks--particularly vulnerable to becoming skeptical of any sort of climate action. These groups used of ads, rallies, and social media to pick at people's economic uncertainty and that to me is so repugnant and despicable. To prey on the people who are just trying to figure out their economic situation and make it through their daily lives to advance their big money fossil fuel interests is sick. And they did everything knowingly. I forgot what guy it was but one of them started smiling actual joy when the interviewer mentioned the skepticism they created among people. He was pretty much saying how it was a win for them because diminishing the consensus on scientific credibility brought climate action to a halt. These people are toying with our future and our lives and it seems that they feel no remorse and it's disgusting. Fast forward to 2020 and the seeds they planted are still growing. There are still many many people who continue to attack the credibility of the science and are adamant in the climate crisis being some made up thing by the left. Honestly though I feel like we were at a point where we can't continue to have the same conversation over and over again about whether or not anthropogenic climate change is real. It is real. It is happening. It is affecting people now. We know this and we need to stop having the same debate and actually take action to combat this incredibly scary issue.

<br><Hr>

I totally agree with what you said. This world is still unfair and probably would never become completely fair. People with political power and wealth would hold more power over those scientists who hold the truth. When I saw Michael Shermer in the film were cursed by those audiences who were climate change deniers, I felt that it is so difficult to convince people who don't agree with you even with data in your hand. Those scientists spent their lives doing researches to try to make a better and more habitable earth for us and our offsprings. However, as I saw in the film those scientists were receiving emails cursing them to die, I just didn't know what to say but sighed.

<br><Hr>

I totally agree with your points. In the interview, most of the skeptics hold an attitude that global warming is not happening, or it is not mainly caused by human activities. Their statements are irresponsible. When the negative consequences of global warming start to show up, when animals and some people lost their home, when some species extinct because of global warming, an apologize and that non-of-my-business smile on your (Myron Ebell) face is not going to make up for their losses. 97% scientists are trying to tell people how bad we are exploiting our planet and how urgent it is to do something to reduce the impact of human activities on global warming, but there are still such a great amount of people doubt this situation. Why? Because someone or some group of people prevented the correct information from reaching the ordinary people. I believe that most people will not choose to pay less tax at the price of the living condition of their children, However, the organizations that the so-called scientists and politicians formed allowed people to believe that advocates of the environment are using the tax they pay improperly. There is no doubt that most of the politicians are aware of the truth that global warming is happening and mostly caused by human activities, since, as Bob Inglis indicates, people believes in the majority of authority. However, either for receiving more support from people, or for the profit they might get from doing so, they choose to lie to themselves and to the ordinary people. 
<br><br>
I think your “extreme” solution to this problem is quite reasonable. It is time to legislate new policies against those who intentionally spreads false information and incites common people to gain higher reputation. It is good to be skeptical, but skepticism is supposed to help us to approach the truth, not using the power and money to lie to the common people and defame their opposite side. Science should not be involved in politics, otherwise we will gradually destroy the ecosystem and our own habitat.

<br><Hr>

I found it infuriating too with that simple "sorry" and how many of the deniers were showing off their bright, happy smiles whenever something wrong happened with their opponents, those that believe in climate change. What sickens me the most is how it feels like a game. Those that deny that climate change is real is making this strange game out of "who will win and who will lose?" This whole movie made my blood boil every time they said, "we won this one boys". Like excuse me? Our planet, our future, and our livelihood is not at all a game sir. They are treating this as Russian Roulette, and we are very close to shooting the bullet because of how much they keep shooting their shots at the idea that climate change is not real. The one thing that really had me up on my feet was when Fred Singer believed that the 97% of scientists that said climate change is caused by human action, were all delusion. That does not add up, these are hard facts that they are presenting and yet you want to STILL say "They are delusional"? Climate change skeptics are just poking the sleeping bear that is Mother Earth, with a stick that is fossil fuel emissions, and that bear is going to wake up and wreak havoc on all of us.


<br><Hr>

Exactly!!! My thought and feeling watching the film were just like yours. It upset me so much and honestly could not believe some of the people in this. Bob Inglis, that nice and woke guy. The doctor scenarios was so good, and the fact that that's the last thing he said before leaving was a bit badass. Like you have so many people telling you the same thing, and two aren’t, it would be the obvious choice to go with the one most people agree with. 
<br><br>
The Politicians who denied climate change were infuriating as well, I mean I get that they need their people to support them but they could've done more while in office. Inglis was amazing, he was fired but he didn’t leave before addressing the real issues. He didn't change nor was pressured to change his views just because people in his city didn’t believe the truth. 
<br><br>
Yes! These politicians should really be in jail because promoting these climate killing policies will kill more people as well. Everything you said is exactly true, how many more people do we have to see lose their lives, loved ones, and homes. Do we really have to get to the point where we personally experience something so people will start believing. 
<br><br>
Lastly, it would honestly bring so much more to switch to renewable energy. There will be more jobs and since all our country cares about is capitalism, the economy would prosper as well. The  climate change skeptics really are prolonging the inevitable, the climate will continue heating up, just like the chart they used to say “there's been cooling” shows. Yes it shows there's been cooling but that cooling is happening as it is also warming up. If you pay attention to the chart it shows that the climate is really heating up.
<br><br>
I found it disturbing when professor Hiltner said that fossil fuel companies measure their worth by the amount of fossil fuel still not extracted that they own. The bank thing made sense, but the fact that money is more important really sucks, they have enough why do they need more. Is their money really worth more than peoples lives as well as the planets?

<br><Hr>

This response is so valid, and I feel the same way. It's amazing to me how people can still deny climate change even when there is direct evidence proving it. After watching this movie, I, too, felt completely hopeless. There is a MAJOR sense of betrayal knowing that the people in office are only concerned with campaign support and money and are not willing to think about the consequences that might not affect them, but will affect a majority of the rest of the world. 

<br><br>

I guess the easiest way to put it, watching these documentaries made me pissed. Straight up pissed, and like you said- the fact that Ebell has the audacity to say "sorry"? That's it. I agree with you on the fact that people like him, should, in fact be imprisoned. You said it's extreme, but when you put it into perspective- what is the difference between people who support policies that will end up being the cause of death for millions of people and a serial killer? Yes, THIS may sound extreme, but accelerated tropical storms, tornadoes in santa barbara and wildfires, just to name a few will have killed and will continue to kill much more people than serial killers/people in jail that are viewed to be a danger to the public.

<br><Hr>
I totally agree with your idea. Those politicians’ jobs are making this climate crisis topic seems disputable. However, climate issue must be handled without any delay. Some people would like sacrifice the environment for their own profits. In order to fulfil this purpose, those people would do anything. Bribing scientists, bribing politicians are only a few of their means. So, the environment is still being polluted, and an apology is seeming less sincerely. The extreme solution which you mentioned is the best solution from my perspective. People with wealth and high reputation should be responsible to their information that provided to the public. Those people are mean to give people truth of the climate crisis not telling people the wrong information.

<br><Hr>
I largely agree with what you said. More specifically I largely agree with what you said about the general feedback from policies that limit fossil fuel consumption. Now, to begin with, politicians aren't known to be the most educated on environmental policy and so at times, I do factor that in when their policies largely damage the environment. However, when it comes to the economic policy I know for a fact that politicians are highly educated on that matter. Speaking from an economic standpoint switching to renewable and sustainable energy isn't a bad thing. Economists love to ask the long term vs short term question and so yes I agree in the short term it will be more costly to switch to renewable energy. It will affect the operations of things and it may largely affect the overall company productivity. However, that is all very momentarily.  In the long run, if we carry on using fossil fuels our planet will be completely and utterly destroyed. If politicians create policies that do enhance the consumption of sustainable energy then firstly, there'll be a large decrease in terms of the production of greenhouse gases and the overall air pollution will decrease. Secondly, through switching away from oil it allows for the diversification of energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels. This will prove to be a huge centerpiece in economic growth as we all know oil prices to be highly volatile. Finally, as you touched on, switching the sustainable energy aids in reating economic development and jobs in manufacturing, installation and servicing industry. This will overall promote economic growth and promote the safety of our planet.
<br><Hr>
I was thinking the exact same thing when Ebell's response was that he would be sorry. Great. Now is the time to be sorry and help fix the mess you've been contributing to. This documentary also left me feeling hopeless in humanity and in our governmental system. I really liked the way the filmmakers interviewed republicans because it was straight forward and left room for their honest response. The sick child and the 98 doctors is a really good analogy that forces people to fully understand how they're is "always debate", but doesn't mean the 2% needs to be amplified equally. I have such a huge appreciation for Republicans or a member of any party who is willing to have their own opinion and not just blindly follow their party. I think that is where changing the image of climate change from a political issue to a collective issue can truly start.
<br><br>

The idea of anonymous donors really pisses me off especially when it is being referred to as "charitable". I wish that information had to legally be exposed to the public. I honestly don't even know how to rant about it other than just saying it completely makes me angry. Manipulation of the public is a real and serious issue and dark money is that manipulation.
<br><Hr>

I too get extremely frustrated when watching either of these documentaries. There is so something that is so innately frustrating about seeing these people deliberately lie to the public out of their own best interests and the interests of those who pay them. I mentioned in my comment on the last video that this kind of direct spread of misinformation and doubt mongering should be illegal. Those who spread it should be held responsible similar to a person yelling "fire" in a crowded theater. I think the most concerning thing about this is that, despite these documentaries being out for so long now, some of these doubt mongers are still puttering around  spreading misinformation with no punishment. One would hope that this wave of war-hawk "scientists" and journalists would figuratively and literally die off, but I am concerned that their influence has reached even the likes of our fellow students. This media struggle is just extremely frustrating and it makes one feel terribly for the actual scientists who are trained and passionate about their discipline, being slandered in the name of false pretense.

<br><Hr>

I absolutely agree with you! This film proved to be extremely infuriating at times and also left me feeling hopeless. In particular, I also empathize with the scientists who have dedicated their lives to climate change only to be vilified. One thing this documentary has made clear is that there are too many people who aren’t specialized scientists who are presenting themselves as leading figures in the field when they’re either just ignorant or have an ulterior motive for spreading misinformation. It’s definitely a reminder that we need to be cautious about what we read, hear, and believe. 

<br><br>

I still think it’s ridiculous that the issue of climate change has become so political when it really should have never become a political issue in the first place.   
<br><br>


Bob Ingils’ analogy where he compared the climate change debate to healthcare and a doctor’s diagnosis was extremely effective and I think it really puts things in perspective. 

<br><br>

It’s distressing that a lot of people simply can’t be bothered to do anything about climate change because they are not directly affected (yet). But the truth is millions of people are losing their homes and forced to change their lives. Right now, many of those most affected by climate change are those who haven’t even “benefitted” from the consumerism and industrialism that has caused the problem. 
<br><br>


It scares me to think of what it will take to change things. How extreme will things have to get before we, as a whole country, mobilize our efforts to save our planet?
<br><Hr>

It blew my mind to see how focused people are to discount and creative confusion about the climate crisis just to be able to maintain the damaging effects that our economy relies on. It does a good job explaining both sides of the issue as well as how the climate crisis became a hotly debated political issue. The representative who disagreed with scientific evidence proving that climate change is human-caused because it isn't "so sound" is a huge reason why the necessary steps haven't been taken worldwide. I agree that politicians who deny our impact on the environment need to have legal action taken against them because they are using their platform to spread misinformation that will continue us on this dark path should no proper action be taken. It's pathetic that people like Fred Singer use important issues such as this as a way to create confusion for the purpose of slowing down our progression into becoming more environmentally responsible and retaining his power and wealth.

<br><Hr>

I agree that the analogy of the sick child and the doctors was a perfect way to describe the situation. It's actually insane how people would side with something that they are well aware is not right just because of the monetary gain that they could have. Although it may seem extreme, I also agree that politicians who deny climate change should be locked up. The policies in place right now are harming not only our environment, but the millions of people who are affected by it. I think that those who deny climate change should see how it affects those living in poverty or affected by the fires or are in any way harmed by climate change. Switching to renewables is really what has to be done so that we don't totally ruin our planet and destroy the environment. People who try to make us doubt that climate change is real should suffer the consequences, but they don't. There is no justice in this system and those who work hard to prove climate change and try to better the situation don't get the results they deserve.

<br><Hr>

I really liked the point you made about climate skeptics simply prolonging the time before we take action. While I don't believe that we will be using 100% renewable energy any time soon, I also disagree with the notion that we shouldn't be taking any steps towards that goal. I totally agree that sooner or later people will come to realize that we need to start making changes in regards to our energy consumption and that denying that fact for monetary or political reasons is a futile effort.
 <br><br>

One point that you made that I have to disagree with is locking up politicians who deny climate change. While I might agree that they are stupid, you can't simply put them in jail for that. I don't actually believe you made that statement literally, but I do think that there are people who have similar sentiments and do mean them literally. Even though locking up stupid people might be great for the world, that would set a pretty bad precedent. Plus, after all, we all do have a right to our own opinion, as misguided as that opinion may be.

I completely agree with you, I feel embarrassed and disgusted to hear Myron Ebell's response of "I would be sorry". I truly believe that the naivete portrayed by the film would be too late for an apology. In Ebell's case, I understand his opposition regarding climate change being a fantasy, but I don't think its safe to assume that even him, someone with that power and financial wealth would be able apologize when calamity hits. I realized that it is easy for most of these political leaders to argue that climate change is not real due to the fact that they have not experience the tragedy that climate change brings. Yes, they are scientist that rely on rational thinking based on different variety of data and experiments. However, It saddens me to hear that some scientist and political leaders prefer to not "answer" any question thrown to them about climate change. I feel like most of them are trying to hide away from the sad truth of climate change, that no one is safe. Moreover, I am embarrassed to think that most of these leaders and scholars are trying to hide themselves for reality, all for the sake that there is more money given to them if the issue remains constrained, rather than the amount of money or credit they could gain in focusing their energy to solve the climate crisis.

After watching the film, I couldn't believe how the climate change deniers find any way possible to discredit climate change. I enjoyed how the film attempted to give us a view through the lenses of a denier. Although a lot of the film was centered around the view and argument of a climate change denier, it really didn't accomplish much. It mostly just consisted of people using trigger words such as fake, a hoax, conspiracy. There was never a real concrete argument made through studies and science. The graph by Fred Singer is highly questionable and I do not consider that actual science.   I believe what this film illustrated is how people will tell themselves anything to make themselves feel better. These people did and do not want to accept that their lifestyle and decisions have a major impact on the earth. They have already lived the majority of their lives, and for them to admit that they caused a negative impact on the arth is too much for them to handle. So they would rather lice the rest of their life in a constant state of denial instead of make a change and accept what they cant change. I find people that accept that they made bad choices in the past and decide to change their lifestyle for the better to be very inspirational and a major force for good in the world.

You pulled out some of the most impactful scenes of A Climate of Doubt in your response here. I felt the same infuriating thoughts in response to Myron Ebell and his barely thought out and lazy answer with just a simple, “I would be sorry.” It makes me think, that’s it? That’s all you had to say? With people out there that just do not seem to care anymore or care in general, it seems so hard to pull together enough of our population body to go against people that are trying to pull people in the wrong direction on climate crisis beliefs. As for your reference to Bob Ingils’ analogy, I was absolutely in line with it, and felt like he made it such a clear depiction of what is happening behind the scenes of the climate change and the politics and reasoning behind why what is happening is happening. The skewing of data through misinformation, bribery, and other tricks- is incredibly dangerous, and with the wrong education, could influence a new generation of individuals that were taught to do all the things we should be discouraging, all because they were in a sense, “brainwashed” by these fossil fuel industries, indirectly. Another great point you put within your response is your understanding of why there are arguments from people that would be unhappy with fossil fuel limitation policies, which is indeed a huge part of our economy. But once again, all things should be at balance, and at control, not taken in excess and in amounts that will further ruin our planet. We must seek other ways, better ways, for a sustainable life to be possible, and find other, new, improved ways to sustain our economy as well. There can be a way to do this, we just need to put all our resources to care enough, unlike points shown in this film, where we act in defeat like Ebell. We should not just resort to, “Well, I guess I will be sorry.” It is of crucial importance that we take action proactively.

<br><Hr>

I think that with the majority of people here, I feel the same way about Ebell's comment; I was infuriated about it as well. I'm not usually one to get mad when watching these sorts of things, but that one frustrated me. What kind of person is just that incapable of feeling or having any remorse? Politics and corruption skew the perspective on climate change for sure; the policies that limit fossil fuel consumption are interesting things to think about. The oil industry is huge obviously, and the switch to renewables would be ideal. However, it's strange to think about how easily or not so easily this could be done. Renewable energy is the future, but how long will it take to get there? 
 <br><br>

After Obama began the "cap-and-trade" initiative to reduce carbon emissions, the economy began to go south, thus causing the perspectives on climate change to become divisive and immediately developing events such as the Hot Air movement in response to showcase the people pushing back against the policy and also climate change. Yes, life for some people got a lot more difficult because of taxation, but this just further proves the fact that Americans love to live the simplest life. Convenience over anything, even if that means a worse future for their children and their children's children. It also annoyed me in a sense how skeptics tried to keep using Climategate and data manipulation (for the cooling trends) as a way to erode climate change. The skeptics could not sway me, but like how Bob Ingils put it, I can see why some people would choose to turn against the tide under the influence of money.

I very much agree with your points and feel the same emotions that you felt. Sorry is not enough for destroying the planet. You did this to us and now sorry is all you can say? These people aren’t going to experience that the climate crisis has and will cause like we will in our lifetimes. So why risk it? Even given their arguments (which are false) what are the downsides of cleaning up our planet? Is it profit? We need to get out priorities straight before it’s too late and the greedy fossil fuel industry is doing everything to stop our efforts. Most people who get up, go to work, watch some TV, go to bed and repeat seem to only have to time to take things at face value. Which is why these arguments have festered among many communities. We need to get better at giving them a counter argument in way that’s easy to understand but I worry that it’s almost too late.

<br><Hr>

This documentary also left me almost hopeless. If we felt this discouraged by the film, I can only imagine how scientist who have dedicated their lives to researching the threat and what we can do to save humankind feel. It would be extremely disheartening to be desperately trying to spread awareness about this huge issue and still face people with this much ignorance. Ignorance and flat out selfish intentions for solely financial gain. I also noted how Bob Inglis described the crisis. It just seems absurd at this point that a community is forming in support of the two percent of scientists that disagree with anthropogenic climate change. But I suppose it is not that absurd if you take into consideration how political this problem has become. I liked how you put it; money is a huge factor in decision making. Fossil fuel interests are making this major threat a debate, when we should be working as a unit to fight this crisis. I also like that you mention how people are scared to switch to renewable energy and risk disrupting the oil industry, but in fact the switch will create more jobs and economic prosperity. And even if the switch doesn’t benefit our economy, change is necessary. 
 <br><br>
 The ignorance of the men in this film scared me. I cannot believe there is a conference every year, that appears to be expanding, in which people “fight for scientific truth.” They believe scientists are being political rather than factual when the support they have themselves from fossil fuel industries is almost obvious. I found it interesting how they gained support. Their strategies included Al Gore’s film and using his controversial standing to their advantage, taking an anti-tax stance to get the support of anyone protecting their money, and the “climate gate.” I found the “climate gate” ridiculous. A few emails and they tried to invalidate the entire climate change idea. The goal of this group is to create doubt, as professor Hiltner mentioned, and we all need to be educated enough to resist it.

<br><Hr>

I agree with everything you said. It is so shocking to see how tunnel visioned some people can be about such a large scale issue. How they only see the moment and the money in front of them rather than seeing the major damage and consequences their singular actions can lead to. This is most true for the corrupt politicians who continue to play into the cyclic system of destruction by supporting the fossil fuel companies who bribe them, and stay manipulated by the game of power. But not only do they not act in favor of the climate crisis and protecting the millions who will have their homes, and source of food destroyed but they deny the threat is occurring at all. The doctor anecdote is something that really brought light to this situation, like discrediting a doctor who has trained for a decade to provide medical help, discrediting scientist who put their heart and soul into finding answers to save the earth is extremely disrespecting and honestly disgusts me. We elect politicians to as the voice of what the people want, however this documentary shows that sometimes once politicians gain a taste of power, it is as if their moral code changes, they are no longer in it for the best of the people, but for themselves. A sorry will never be close to enough to the destruction the current day decisions of our leaders will cause. It will never eliminate the pain, death, and overall destruction many will face in the near future. The only way to continue moving in the right direction is to do exactly what this class is doing for us, to become aware, spread awareness, and stand by the solutions to this crisis.

You couldn’t have said it more perfectly. An apology has no significance when we are well aware of the problem and have the opportunity to act. It’s completely ignorant and selfish for these companies to be putting their finances ahead of the well being of billions of people, animals, the entire WORLD. This situation reminds me of a situation we discussed in ethics last quarter: if there were a drowning child in front of you, would you ruin your clothes and be late to work to save them? Of course you would. Then why aren’t we willing to apply that to other situations and help people on the other side of the world who are battling disease, hunger, etc. This thought experiment extends to the climate crisis as well. If we would save the drowning child even if it requires sacrifice, then why aren’t we willing to make sacrifices to save millions of people in developing countries, or the thousands of endangered animals, or our kids, or our future selves? 
 <br><br>

I also agree on Bob Inglis’ point about how if 2 out of 100 doctors suggested a different treatment for a sick child it would be nonsense to listen to those two rather than the other 98. It is understandable why those 2 might possibly be convincing if they lie to invalidate the others, but in this case it is so obviously better to listen to those 98 and be safe rather than sorry. These 2 doctors represent the skeptics of the climate crisis, including those of the Heartland Institute, however, despite them and their efforts, I believe that if we come together effectively at the same time as making changes individually, we can overcome climate change
<br><Hr>
I completely agree. Every point that resonated with me in the film is mentioned in this comment. It is sad that the climate crisis is viewed by some as a "political consensus." There is nothing political in the fact that people and species are dying because of the severe changes to our planet that we have caused. I was shocked to hear what some of the climate change deniers said about the topic; they said the world is cooling. These people will go to great lengths to find any way to convert people to their ignorant and selfish ways of thinking. 
 <br><br>

The point that Bob Ingils, a die hard republican, made really resonated with me. He pained the picture of climate scientists like doctors, and 98 of them are in agreement, and two others, the climate change deniers, disagree with the rest. That visual was very powerful in portraying that 98 in 100 scientists are convinced on climate change, but still somehow parts of the general public are still not convinced.  It is so sad that there is a battle for the support of the American public on the subject because the issue is nothing but facts. 
 <br><br>

The interviews of the climate change deniers were eerie in that they could so easily deny the undeniable. When presented with facts, these people choose to not listen, or laugh like it is a joke. I was also disappointed, yet not surprised to see that at the meeting of "Defending the American Dream Summit," the makeup of climate change deniers was almost, if not entirely, white. This shows that the demographic of people who choose to ignore the facts and the people who support the fossil fuel industry is anything but diverse. This makes me ashamed and deeply disappointed. It is sad that people care more about money than the planet, or seem to think that the state of the planet doesn't matter.

<br><Hr>

It seems that, through whatever means they are publicizing their opinions, climate change deniers pursue the same core tactics: questioning the validity of the scientists’ opinions who believe in climate change, and ultimately falling back on the economic harm to citizens. Logically, both of these are sound ideas, because, if your audience is confused about what the truth really is, then they are probably not going to support legislation. That becomes amplified when groups like The Heartland Institute convince everyday citizens that the “liberal, bi-coastal elitist democrats” want you to pay more for electricity and gas and make your life much more difficult. 
 <br><br>
In fact, the combination of these two strategies reminded me a lot of the courtroom, and in this scenario, deniers are acting as the defense, paid a lot of money by fossil fuel companies, the defendants, to convince the public, the jury, that the only crime they have committed is making people’s lives easier. In a criminal case, as a juror, you need to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. So long as the deniers can confuse, rattle, or just make people hesitate about the severity, cause, or existence of climate change, then they are winning, and that is exactly what they are allowed to do in the status quo, a fact elucidated in Climate of Doubt. Never have the words of deniers terrified me more than when Myron Ebell simply stated he would owe the world an apology if he were wrong. My only qualm, which seems to match yours, is this: Mr. Ebell, what world will be left for you to apologize to?

<br><Hr>

I think it would be a little extreme to place politicians who deny the climate crisis in jail. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, but those who do not believe in the climate crisis are ignorant and dumb. I agree that the deniers should be more than sorry for not believing in the climate crisis. Those who are deniers are just selfish but if we want future generations to live in a safe world, we need to make some positive changes towards fixing the crisis. I want my kids to live in a safe, harmless world and if we want this to happen our generation needs to act. I also agree that we need to make changes towards more renewable sources, such as energy. WE must find ways to limit the use of fossil fuels and reduce the CO2 emitted into our atmosphere everyday. The deniers are honestly irrelevant and should be ignored if we want to make steps towards fixing the climate crisis. The documentary is honestly frustrating to watch because it shows how so many people are ignorant of the hard facts behind our climate crisis. It is hard to watch the deniers not care about the Earth they live on and the possibilities to come if we do not make changes to our lifestyles.

<br><Hr>

I totally agree with so much of what you said. An apology would do absolutely nothing. An apology can’t turn back time and reverse the damages of climate change. What can make a difference are the things we do today to save our planet. This documentary made me angry because these climate change deniers are only after money. They don’t have good intentions, their only intention is to gain money. They are willing to put money before the place they inhabit. It’ll ruin their descendants future on this earth and all they will be doing is saying, “I’m sorry.” I really liked the analogy that Ingils used to describe this debate. I think it was amazing to see a politician really speak for something they believe is a problem and not conform to what they know people want to hear. However I do think that what you said about locking up climate change deniers is taking it too far. I totally understand the frustration with them though.


<br><Hr>

I agree. It is really disheartening to know just how many people there are out there who still deny climate change. At this point there is just too much evidence that climate change is real to even be able to deny it. Yet again and again we see people denying it and making excuses for the effects that we are seeing, declaring that these cycles are normal when there is so mcuh about them that is not. It hurts me most when I hear people close to me denying the effects of climate change, and also denying how much of an impact them as one person makes. If these people who had such strong opinions on denying climate change but half of that same effort back into making even a couple more sustainable choices then our whole world would be better off. This is the same for the big fossil fuel companies who spend thousands of dollars on brainwashing the population. It would be much cheaper to be honest, and invest this money into trying to find sustainable solutions to the issues they are propelling.
 <br><br>

Unfortunately, the sad reality of the situation is that there will always be a lot of climate change deniers until they too are feeling extreme pain as a result of their incessent denial. And unfortunately I don’t think we will have to wait too long til this unfortunate consequence occurs. The scary due dates of so many disasters as a result of climate change are right around the corner.

<br><Hr>

 I can’t agree with you more. The  analogy Bob Ingils made was so apt that it reveals the relationship between us and the falling earth that we inhabit. Those scientists who accepted the money and let their voices be manipulated are not so different from the parents who are bribed into a medical treatment that negatively affects the health of their kid. Of course everyone can see the impact of global warming on our lives. The fire in Australia is a sign, the pervading of plague in China and North America and the famine caused by the locust attack in Africa are all directly or indirectly triggered by the rise of temperature. We really have no time for the game of politics.

<br><Hr>


Yes. The Climate of Doubt is an impressive movie. Since the movie is short, the movie only shows the opinion of both sides. The reason for the opinion and specific evidence of the opinion is not shown. After watching the film, the audience can read the Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming to better understanding the detail, in turn, to understand the general outline of the environmental issue. The documentary, for sure, has the bias, since it is taken by the democracy election organization. However, it is still a good resource to understand the environmental issue. 

 <br><br>

The uncertainty is always the biggest problem for the global warming topic. There are too many variables in this topic. Based on our current scientific ability, nether of both sides can persuade the each other and people with a series of solid evidence. Thus, the key point becomes the efficiency of protecting the environment. If trying to stop global warming, people, especially bottom people, will sacrifice a lot of their life. However, the problem may be solved after they die, they did not take any benefit. If global warming just normal or slowly, to keep production and lifestyle is the best option. For politician, this also the better and practical way to get votes.

<br><Hr>

You make a valid point, this documentary, " A Climate of Doubt" made me frustrated because of many conservatives and left side skeptics creating a showcase and instilling doubt in the population. The documentary presents many of the heartland institute contributors being interviewed and mainly getting asked what they think about climate change and if they think it is caused by mankind. At some point in the documentary, a reporter told her experience of confronting skeptics and asking them why they do not believe global warming is caused by mankind and they all either end up ignoring her or not having an answer at all. This proves that there is no significant evidence or a well-reasoned answer that can back up the views of conservatives that don't believe in climate change. Every claim that they would make was unreasonable to me because real credible evidence was never really shown by them. I believe these people like professor Ken mentioned are only trying to extract as much fossil fuels as they can for their wealthy companies and earn a profit from the value of fossil fuels before any laws are mandated. In addition, when conservatives and politicians express their views of not believing in climate change, they build doubt and confusion among the people and this utterly results in a lack of human action to prevent and decrease greenhouse gases. In the end, we end up not agreeing with one side as a whole and as a result, it elongates the process that we need to take action now to begin emitting fewer greenhouse gases and regulating laws that will benefit our environment for the sake of all of our lives.

Your comparison between the scientists and the doctors was very true. And it just goes to show where these people's agendas lie. They are all in it for the money, and will come up with any reason, may the data be fabricated or exaggerated. 

 <br><br>

What I found really stupid was when they stated “If you look at the data there is a cooling trend every ten years” 
 <br><br>
The trend was CLEARLY rising. Although it had a few dips around every decade it was still increasing as time went on. The data is right in front of us, but it is up to us to choose to see it or not.

<br><Hr>

I agree with you. What I’m feeling like is just like yours. When I see these industries, led by fossil fuel companies, managed to control the future of humans in their own hands, I feel hopeless but nothing. To tell the truth, I have no idea what I can do at this time. It seems that though scientists acknowledge the problem of anthropogenic climate change, there is still a lot more “capital” we need to fight against, which seems impossible since the poison had been spread out, started with children. 
 <br><br>

In addition, I agree with your point on renewable sources. The renewable source is for sure a reliable source in the future in replace of fossil fuel energy. But the main skill to obtain renewable sources at an affordable price is far away. Are we actually running out of solutions? Confronting the mighty power of capital, should we take silence as our position?

<br><Hr>

I saw something interesting a couple days ago: a poster with a list of things to help everyone do their part in limiting their carbon footprint, and a man standing in the crowd saying, “Even if its not true, why don’t we just improve the world anyway?” The fact that it became a political issue basically proves that the debate isnt a matter of whos right, its about money. As many things are. I was angry after watching “A Climate of Doubt” mostly at peoples selfishness. So many politicians are only thinking term to term, their field of vision never surpassing the next two to four years. It's a dangerous cycle because so many solutions but be implemented for the long term, and the trade-offs take a long time to come to light. This means that politicians have very little interest in a side that will make them NO money, and will not directly help THEM.

 <br><br>

The most frustrating thing is that no one is hiding their interests. Just look at who the Heartland Institute has funding them, and it’s easy to draw the lines. It's also almost painful to watch these politicians take direct aim at environmental policy and cancel them.

<br><Hr>

I'm especially happy you noted the inevitability of renewables. Suppose fossil fuels weren't as horribly disruptive to our planet's ecosystem, there is still only a limited supply of it on the planet and it is a primitive way of harnessing available energy. We are already causing much damage to other civilizations even if we dismiss the effects of climate change on people. A large part of why the U.S. is so deeply involved in the Middle East is to obtain their abundant natural resources through adverse means. The way we have gone about achieving this goal is reason enough to question the sustainability of fossil fuels. Are we a civilization that supports the destabilization of multiple foreign civilizations for the convenience and economic prosperity back home? The details of U.S. intervention in the region is already a topic worthy of a book of it's own, so I will end my discussion of it here and address what is relevant to the argument against fossil fuels. Eventually, there will not be any more fossil fuel to satisfy our energy needs, and alternative will have be sought after. Meanwhile, China and likely other countries are investing in this technology ahead of time and will be technologically superior to the U.S. and probably economically better off as well. Reintroducing the climate change concern is almost unnecessary, yet we live in a timeline where it is.

<br><Hr>


I felt exactly the same way when he said he would only be sorry if climate skeptics are wrong. It makes no logical sense as to wait until the last minute to take action on an issue so critical as climate change. It is not an issue that only affects a certain group of people––it affects everyone. However, oil industries’ cravings for fossil fuels to profit their industry has become a detrimental addiction. It is understandable to pursue after cheap forms of resources but it is not understandable to continue doing so knowing that millions of lives around the globe––human or not––become endangered in the process as greenhouse gas emissions increase and the earth intakes more of it. 
 <br><br>
When there are other solutions that would benefit the earth and the economy, such as investing in more renewable resources, why not do it? I understand that there are many factors that play a role, such as the high costs of inverting towards a greener economy, accessibility to those resources, etc., however, considering the long term benefits of doing so would only ensure a better future. Oil industries cannot rely on the use of fossil fuels forever, they are limited and will run out at some point. This reliance on fossil fuel usage is not beneficial in the long run because its availability is only temporary. Not only are we not allowing species to adapt to a changing environment in time to survive, but we are also depleting the earth’s natural resources at a faster rate than of what it can replenish. 
 <br><br>
 Climate change is not a political issue but it creates them as people begin to migrate across borders and catastrophes create a burden in the economy. I have noticed how much more activism is increasing after climate catastrophes happen back-to-back one after the other or at the same time. It is so upsettingly disturbing to think that these climate rebels have been successful for so long in discrediting climate scientists that the earth’s climate was considerably altered for public to finally see for with their own eyes that scientists were right all along.
 <br><br>
 Yes, reaching the earth’s tipping point would cause catastrophic events to happen but I refuse to believe it would be unfixable. Reaching the tipping point would only lead to less knowledge about the earth’s functions and systems as it would be too altered to apply years and years of research about it. I agree that the planet needs more attention than what it is getting sooner rather than later before we do not know much about it and begins to affect more and more lives.


<br><Hr>

I agree 1000% with what you said.  I completely understand why you think that politicians that deny climate change need to be locked up.  They are crooks for stopping this country from passing the policies we need to fix our planet.  Imagine being one of them and choosing greed over the country you are supposed to be making a BETTER place.  The fact is that the Australia fires will be the first of many travesties to come if nothing is done now.  The forest fires and other natural disasters such as hurricanes are only getting worse as the temperature continues to rise.  A film like this is scary to me because I know it has convinced thousands upon thousands of people that there is no problem and that there is no Climate Crisis.  I have friends back in my home town that references this very video when they are debating with me about Climate Change.  I feel the same way you about the infuriating arguments that these people use to manipulate those that don't know any better.  A lot of people will side will the one that involves less change so they are already more inclined to believe this video and their message.  The best thing to finish my comment with is the quote you used from Bob INgils because it shines such a big light on the climate skeptics lies.  “Your child is sick, you take him to the doctor if 98 doctors tell you to do one thing, and two tell you to do the other, are you going to listen to the two?”

<br><Hr>

I second what you said. What these politicians are doing is essentially a crime. It's a crime to be aware of the fact that stealing is wrong, and then go out to brake the law for your benefit. Just as these climate change deniers are aware of the malicious content that they are spreading to the teachers, school children and general public for their own benefit. I know that they are aware that what their saying is wrong. There's just no way,  if not they wouldn't go as far as to willingly go out and give out free books that serve only as a malicious attempt to protect their money in the bank. The truth is that these multimillion companies only have one central focus, and that is money. I find this so sad. They are choosing instant gratification and failing to recognize that money will not matter when we've essentially killed our planet because of their harmful resources. These kids will grow up, taking what they've learned from their teachers and develop that as their truth. And if the opposite side of the story (climate change activists) don't come in and intervene the ideas that they are maliciously speeding, these children will grow up believing lies fed to them by the biggest names in the fossil fuel industry. What a shame.

<br><Hr>

I, like you, was incredibly infuriated by Ebell's response. By then it will be far too late for sorry's. That's one thing that's always confused me about those that are confused. Say you're on the fence about whether an anthropogenic climate crisis exists. Wouldn't a pretty simple assessment of the risks cause you to err on the side of caution? If somehow 97% of climate scientists and the majority of the politicians that don't have big oil in their bed and the US military are all wrong, yet we choose to be safe and curb our emissions, then our consequences are an economy that doesn't endlessly grow (produce as much wealth for the wealthy as it does now) and some daily headaches like paying over $5 for a T-Shirt or choosing a salad over a hamburger for lunch. If however, everything that the smart money is saying is true, the consequences are truly devastating. It seems to me that doubt shouldn't keep you from stopping at a red light, even if someone's shouting in your ear that its green.

<br><Hr>


Wow, this comment is my thought exactly. Crazy how climate skeptics are so stubborn that they choose to ignore what is happening around them. They don't care what is happening around them, all they care about are their egos and money. That "I would be sorry" was so emotionless. But watch the consequences of their actions affect their grandchildren and they are basically saying 'f*** you' by doing nothing and choosing to ignore the climate crisis. I agree, the reference of who to listen to when your child is sick, the 98 doctor or the 2 other doctors. Of course you are going to listen to the 98 doctors rather than the other 2 so what's the difference here? Well, money. Climate skeptics are saying switching our entire system would cost so much but in reality, we would be saving money by starting now instead of waiting for the worst to happen then we would have to fix everything before we could start a new system. Not only waiting would cost more money, but it would cost millions of lives. Why risk innocent peoples lives? That's just so wrong.


<br><Hr>
I agree on fact that people are scared to admit and take action against the climate crisis because the economy relies so much on the fossil fuel industries. Yet as you mentioned the switch to renewable energy would create employment which will help with the unemployment by fossil fuel companies if regulations for the climate crisis are passed. The important thing is to act now because the climate crisis is getting worse per day.
<br><Hr>
I was appalled when Myron Ebell’s response was simply “I would be sorry." A sorry with no action to fix the situation means nothing. This shows that he would not take complete responsibility for contributing to spreading misinformation and setting back the progress of so many people towards saving the planet. It definitely will be too late for an apology when the planet is destroyed. His response frustrated me in addition to the ignorance displayed by climate change deniers, especially when they wrongly manipulate data to prove their point. All for what? Money? Political power? None of these will matter when our planet become inhabitable and we all seize to exist.
 <br><br>

I find it upsetting how much has changed regarding politicians' (in)action now compared to years ago. Back then, people were worried and actively trying to seek solutions to save the planet. However, times have changed because of the doubt that have been sowed among the public by these climate change deniers despite the general consensus among scientists, those with actual evidence. I also agree that Bob Ingils described the climate debate really well. His comparison allowed a better visualization regarding the situation. It is difficult, if not impossible, to have every single person living on this planet to agree on a certain point. However, I do not know how we would survive if we do not change our lifestyle with all of the destruction we are currently witnessing at this moment.
<br><Hr>
After watching the film A Climate of Doubt, the most obvious feeling I had was being mad at those people who denied global warming, climate changes, and other environmental issues that we are experiencing right now. Those fossil fuel companies value their own benefit much more than our planet, and this made them insist that  global warming is not taking place  or it’s not human’s fault for the climate to change. I’m disappointed to find that those people are so selfish and stubborn. There was one politician in the film said that CO2 is a good thing because it’s plant food. I was shocked and started to doubt if this guy got his high school  diploma or not. When I heard “global warming is bullshit” in the film lead by another guy who’s not a scientist, my feelings were very complicated, and I felt that those people are so unforgivable. 

 <br><br>

People really need to know what is happening right now instead of blindly follow those phoney, selfish politicians and public figures who only care about their own benefit. People need to learn about the data and facts of our environmental issues. These undeniable sources can definitely shut those liars up and give out the truth.
<br><Hr>
I wholeheartedly agree with your response, and I love your use of Ingil's analogy on climate change. Under any other circumstance, people would absolutely be inclined to gravitate towards the opinions that the majority of people hold. But for some reason, when it comes to climate change and issues that maybe don't affect them at the very moment but inevitably will, they don't care because greed, materialism, and misinformation tells them otherwise. This documentary is so frustrating in so many aspects, because the people who CAN make huge and impactful differences won't ever do it because of money. If fossil fuel giants and other climate deniers pay their way into a politician's heart and campaign, there is literally nothing that will convince that person to do something about the climate crisis. It infuriates me with how irresponsible these powerful and high-ranking climate change deniers are. 
 <br><br>

I often wonder, with how rapid climate change is occurring, what these people will think when their children, grandchildren, friends, constituents, etc, start suffering the consequences of their negligence towards the environment? Ebell's "sorry" is undoubtedly empty in sincerity, but I would genuinely like to see, in the next 10-20 years, what climate denying politicians have to say about climate change when it's their voter's land that's been swallowed by the rising sea levels; when their family's home burns down in a fire, or is demolished by increasingly ferocious hurricanes; when ecosystems across the world are destroyed beyond repair for things like fossil fuels or palm oil, and they'll only know that animals like tigers, elephants, koalas, or whale sharks existed at some point in the past. I just wonder what it will take to force them to forgo caring about money and greed and actually care about the people whose lives and wellbeing they are partially responsible for.

<br><Hr>
I had the same reactions to the response that Myron Ebell had made when discussing the chance that he was incorrect. It is unacceptable that so many climate change skeptics do not even attempt to show empathy to those who are already being affected by the negative effects of climate change. Apart from the nonchalant sorry that Ebell says,  figures such as James Sensenbrenner and Ebell again seem to take pleasure when finding convenient things to further their argument instead of actual science. Ebell stated how he liked how Al Gore was the face of climate change because of how controversial he is which would make it easier to garner support against him, and Sensenbrenner talked about the recession like it was a good thing because it made people focus more on the economic parts of the cap and trade limits of carbon instead of the bigger picture. I believe there are fundamental flaws when supporters against climate change rely on other issues to support their cause. I am saddened that people believe blatant lies such as how global warming has not harmed humans when it has already negatively affected many countries over the world and more disappointed in the people that spout these untruths. I believe that connections between oil companies and climate change deniers have to be exposed so everyone can see the true intentions of scientists and policy makers behind the global warming denial so change can be made about the reality of the situation. The climate change doubters have it easier than supporters because they do not need to convince people that it is false, they just need to make them unsure enough to not act which gives fossil fuel companies more oil and money at the expense of the Earth. This is better said by Bob Inglis who asks who to believe, the 98 doctors saying one thing, or the 2 saying the opposite, hoping the public will cast the doubters aside because of the overwhelming acceptance of climate change.

<br><Hr>
I agree with your entire comment. I see why many Americans who work in oil industries and other fossil fuels who don't make millions of dollars like their bosses would likely vote for the politicians denying climate change because it means job security for the short term. However, we need to show people the big picture and the consequences of continuing our current trend. I am sure there are still ways to convert the blue-collar workers of the oil industry to jobs in renewable energy source sectors like wind, hydro and solar, but it is up to the corrupt politicians to do so. What makes the entire situation worse is that it is these corrupt politicians who profit the most from the degradation of our planet.

I would be sorry too, if I ripped homes, water, and air away from innocent people. I would be sorry if it turned out I had lied my way into the greatest sin of a generation.

 <br><br>

But guess what? Greta was right, we will never forgive you.
 <br><br>


You still have twenty good years to change your legacy. You might never earn forgiveness from everyone, but you could at least gain empathy. Bad enough misinformation is just another name for evil, John Paulk didn't earn trust back from anyone he abused when he announced the end of his ex-gay agenda, but at least he stopped doing the damage, you can too. 
 <br><br>


It's not enough, but you'll see the next twenty years of climate change, and when you say you're sorry, I want to hear. I won't forgive you, but I want to hear.
 <br><br>


Sincerely, <br><br>

Me
 <br><br>


I wanted to have a little more fun with that one, but it is so seriously frustrating to see the deception and misinformation. It's so available and so convincing in the age of instant information, and I come from a community really heavily affected by these messages, whether they related to climate change or vaccines. I want more for my country and community than the mess we have to process in currently.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree with your feelings and feel equally infuriated at the nonchalant attitude of the climate skeptics after watching A Climate of Doubt. It is really frustrating knowing that many of the climate skeptics are people that are in the fossil fuel industry. They are people fueled by money and their self interests over the billions of people that are, and will continue to be, affected by the climate crisis. The quote that you pointed out where Bob Ingils said “your child is sick, you take him to the doctor, if 98 doctors tell you to do one thing, and two tell you to do the other, are you going to listen to the two?” also really stood out to me. This climate skeptics that would listen to the two doctors really shows how incredibly biased the climate skeptics are, and their willingness to say something so ridiculous in order to support the fossil fuel industry. I understand your sentiment of locking up climate change deniers. It is horrible that even with all the clear evidence with events that have been happening recently like the fires in Australia, climate deniers are still denying the crisis.
<br><Hr>
I totally agree with you! I couldn't help but feel angry the entire time I watched this documentary. Politicians who genuinely believe that global warming doesn't exist are just plain out stupid. They choose to avoid any issues that arise from climate change due to the fact that they're the ones who are profiting off of all the fracking and oil production found all over the U.S. The longer they choose to believe this isn't an issue, the more money they get to make. The fact that the government had the Official House Committee on Global Warming dissolved just makes me lose hope in our planet. No matter how hard I try to be optimistic about it, I see how many people disagree on the issue. Wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather events are constantly happening all over the world but don't seem to receive any media coverage or financial help from other countries. So many people are losing their houses everyday due to natural disasters produced from global warming and I feel sad that there's nothing I can do to help them. I can only imagine how they feel to lose their homes, and maybe even loved ones. In the end, watching the film "Climate of Doubt" left me feeling more dispirited than I already did.
<br><Hr>
I 100% agree with you. When I was watching this documentary, I notice that they never talked about the actual consequences — how living things on the planet will be affected profoundly. All they focused on is denying and trying to create doubt. This climate change problem should have never become a political issue. Humans caused it, and now we must act to fix it. That simple. But now, it becomes a game of chess that those politicians and fossil fuel interests play to win their money. It is already very sad that the older generation doesn't want to take action because of their beliefs in the "American dream of free enterprise capitalism." However, I felt furious when those guys not only didn't act but tried to brainwash others with anger, frustration, and concern. How dare those people be so selfish and evil.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree with everything that you said. When Myron Ebell gave such a fake and non-genuine apology, I was infuriated with all my heart.  That fake apology is not going to get us and future generations anywhere when it comes to improving the environment. There are so many people out there in this entire planet who are suffering from all of the environmental  damages caused by climate change.
<br><Hr>
I absolutely agree with the majority of what was said. I think that it is disgusting that there are people out there that care more about being right and are too driven by their egos to even consider the other side of the argument, despite being presented with indisputable evidence supporting that other side. It is ridiculous that people would rather see the majority of life on the planet disappear than consider the slightest possibility that they could be wrong.

 <br><br>

While I believe locking up politicians who deny climate change is too extreme, I do agree that something needs to be done. The climate crisis is probably the biggest problem we face right now, not only as citizens of this country, but also as part of the many organisms that call this planet home. It should not be a political debate anymore. The fact that it didn't use to be a debate just reinforces the fact that there is no valid reason to debate now. There has not been any new evidence that indicates that anthropogenic climate change is not real. Politicians deny the facts, and lead the world towards an apocalypse of sorts. They should absolutely be punished, not by locking them up, but by destroying their reputations. Any politician that denies climate change should be seen by the public as the idiot that they are. I think this would help reduce the number of political deniers, as public opinion is one of the most important parts of being a politician.
<br><Hr>

 That "SORRY" was also a great shock for me, and I believe it would be a shock for everybody. It is not like breaking a window and merely paying money to the victim. The aftermath of the climate crisis could be even unpredictable. It could threaten millions even billions of people's lives. I hate to say sorry to them. Now I am realizing the fact that money is beyond lives for some people. I am hoping that these misleading theories in the movie would not hurt anyone or our mother Earth.
<br><Hr>

I totally agree with what you're saying. I think this documentary illustrates the way in which our system is not designed to change. The people that are on top having all the decisive power have far too much stakes in the world functioning as it is now. For them there is so much money to be made out of all these practises that do not benefit any other people (like the tobacco industry for instance). To change this a younger generation needs to step up but how do you do that if you are not in positions of power to do this in time. This picture illustrates the resistance that is put up by the people that have the highest stakes in staying wealthy. They are not one bit concerned about what climate change is already doing to nature and other people that live in more affected places. What is it gonna take for these people to realise that something serious is going on, I think throwing them in jail would be a start.

Politicians are very savvy speakers. They’re good at convincing people of anything. A major problem we’re currently facing is the fact that our government does not prioritize climate change. Climate change should not be a political issue whatsoever. It is important for young Americans to be educated so that hopefully the system can change. Weather and climate are not the same thing. We are facing extreme weather patterns that are only going to get worse! It breaks my heart to think that people who have had their house burned down or flooded still don’t believe in climate change. And a big part of that has to do with our current leaders who deny climate science. Two huge climate deniers, Ebell and Singer, have brainwashed so many people. They’re not even real scientists! How is this possible? It shocks me every time I think about it. Supporting sustainable alternatives and climate change reform is a good thing. But apparently that makes me a left extremist, which is seen as bad by many…

</p><hr>


<p>
I find it interesting to see more of the political take on climate change, as the environmentally conscious foundation of the issue is often the focal point many are more familiar with. This film really does well in showing that frankly, many things are not what they seem to be, and we as consumers must be careful in choosing who we support based on our beliefs. These groups that adopt a facade are well aware of how the interaction between them and the audience works: find something to appeal to a large amount of people’s ideals and market it to gain endorsements and publicity to kickstart personal initiatives that do not align with what the consumer signed up for. To me, it is shameful how common this is put into practice, so much so to the point where this form of promotion can be identified as a textbook tactic to mold the public’s interests under the pressure of ethical breaching and deception. Now, misinformation or the lack of information circulates the media, leaving holes in the story that are quick to be patched up with more false statements. Because of consumers having to question the validity of every movement they see and are interested in joining, the pace of action against climate change has been decelerated. Our planet’s struggle against the elements we have imposed upon it is being veiled by corporate truth, which is anything but.

The Merchant of doubt is really an interesting movie. The merchants use every chance to mislead the people in
<br><Hr>
order to gain their profits. I feel really bad that the normal people always can’t know the truth as the people in power can easily manipulate the normal.

<p>
In “Climate of doubt” there is a theme pushed forward that there are climatologist that do not agree with the notion that there is a climate crisis occurring right now at this moment. 
 <br><br>

However, the reality is that the “doubters”, the climatologist that deny the climate crisis are bought bastards who care not for their principle of ethics nor the field they chose to pursue. They are sad.  
 <br><br>

I find it almost incredulous that people would believe and even support this so called scientists when they're taking money from fossil fuel industries like the Koch brothers and Exxon. Moreover, when they interviewed the politician Fred Singer, it’s obvious that he is neither knowledgeable nor rational—definitely not someone who should be taken as an authority on climate change and such. Gas lighting and misinformation needs to be attacked aggressively.



</p><hr>


<p>
1) Was the film effective at communicating it subject? If so, how did it achieve this?
 <br><br>
Yes, the file effectively communicates this topic. In the beginning, the director uses flashes of Political news and sounds of reports about climate changes to connect the topic of Politics and environment in an interesting way. moreover, the director shows the example of the president straightly in the beginning, which is the most authoritative, to draw people’s attention. Then, in the middle of the video, the director uses contrast to address this issue by debating. It is more than effective to let two sides of people illustrate their sides of opinion and just let audiences to think and compare by themselves while watching it.
 <br><br>

2) Who do you think might be the film’s audience? People already concerned about the issue or casual viewers?
 <br><br>
From my point of view, the audiences who know Politics best fit, since there are a lot of debates about the benefits of party power conflicts. People who are interested in and concern about this issue should be extremely familiar with those political situations. Moreover, there are solutions of saving the environment proposed at the end of the video, people who have views or agree with it must understand environment developments, so people who concern about the world living environment should also be the film’s audiences. 
 <br><br>

3) What was your general reaction to the film? Was your response primarily intellectual or emotional? In other words, how did the film make you feel? What did it cause you to think about? Did you learn anything new from the film? If so, what? Did the film change your attitudes in anyway? If so, how? After watching it, did you feel optimistic or pessimistic?
 <br><br>
Honestly I don’t feel surprised. I’m someone who is interested in Politics too and I’m not shocked what people can do to reach the top of the power as long as they don’t hurt their “ interests” . Even there is someone working in the government truly cares about the environment problem or tries to find a balance between those, because of the atmosphere in the government- a small society which has society competence. People gradually tend to get numb and adapted, which is a little bit ironic but real. The others who want to change the situation have no power to solve the problem. The typical example of this is shown in the film, a lot of comparatively unrelated scientists sign their name to prove the existence of the problem, but turns out it doesn't really work. The film uses a lot of time to do the “interview debate”, which is intense and make people indulge into that atmosphere, then finally feel angry about it, which satisfies the director’s intention. But anyway how, I feel positive about the situation, since the founding of the government is to help the society and the world and it is truly working rather than no institutions are there, even it’s slow and hard.

<p>
I really enjoy the topic about climate change in this  video. Even though my main reactions are in utter disbelief and concern.  Its very interesting to bring this up due to the fact many people have worried about climate change in the past however are now bypassing the fact that it is a major issue. A major political issue at that. Many politicians try to convince the public that it is just a big scam but have no reasons to back up their statement. It’s very heartbreaking to hear facts like Tennessee bringing the topic about climate change into the schools now. It has come to a point where this issue needs to be taught to the youth due to the fact this can be the reason the human race can possibly  be extinct. Bringing the idea of a “what if” centralizes the thought that such a catastrophic event can actually take place. People can be misinformed and they cherry pick what they do and don’t want to hear.

</p><hr>


<p>
While the evidence brought up in this film was disturbing I did enjoy the comparison of the corporations to be similar to conman. The movie demonstrates how these corporations utilize the manipulation of words in order to persuade the consumers that their products are safe. In this film I was shocked to know that the three largest makers of flame retardants were the members of the “Citizens for Climate Safety”. This was upsetting because this just goes to show how little we know as consumers. It is easy to buy and buy without knowing or caring what and who we are supporting. When in reality that is just what corporations want, they do not want the consumers to know the details of their scheme they use the manipulation of words to hide facts from its consumers in order to maintain sales and make profit. 
 <br><br>
In this film it is also upsetting to see how climate skeptics consistently cherry pick their sources and data in order to support that climate change is a hoax. These skeptics always find a way to make things political and to put down climate scientists calling them “alarmists” as a way to alienate them. People like Marc Moreno spread false information and humiliate scientists in order to discredit their work and convince the general public that this matter is of such little importance that he makes humor out of it. This is upsetting because the extent to which he jokes about these issues makes these issues seem exactly like a joke when it is important for people to know the truth not the “truth” given by someone who is not a scientist at all but merely a tv personnel.

<p>
After Watching "Merchant of Doubt" it was surprising to see that people still do not believe that Climate Change is real and that it is here. There has been information far since this movie was made and despite the facts before are still ignorant. However, the movie does a great job to highlight one major factor that is contributing to misinformation and confusion.  Companies that have been profiting from the Climate change are now using their money and power to make sure that nothing changes. The Heartland Institution tried to do it once with cigarettes and smoking back in the 1960s. Now they are trying to confuse people about climate change. This movie does their job to show that these companies are manipulating the public for their own benefit. They are making sure that no one can do anything by misleading the public. They are using their power and money for monetary gain.



</p><hr>


<p>
While watching “A Climate of Doubt” I can say I felt the same way. It’s also frustrating feeling powerless against a political world where our biggest way to contribute comes in the form of a vote rather than being able to physically enact change ourselves. And even so, it’s still a competition to even earn new policies. The statistic that “in four years, the number of Americans who agree global warming is man-made has dropped to half,” doesn’t help with the efforts either. In a society where people tend to believe everything they hear, we are often fed misinformation and are too lazy to check the real facts. In this way, climate change skeptics have the upper hand, presenting things like Fred Singer’s graph of cooling trends to mislead the general public who would most likely disregard the temperature increases. The Global Warming Petition Project, or the Oregon Petition, seems like the only organized skeptic effort, but it holds little validity as it can be signed by anyone with a Bachelor of Science degree and has been signed by celebrities and friends. Shouldn’t we be listening to real scientists that dedicate their lives to research? It’s astonishing how such an impactful topic can be brushed off and unacknowledged by members of Congress whose responsibility is to ensure the safety of the people. Refusing to talk makes them look cowardly, but I know that it’s only so they can keep their positions due to the controversy surrounding climate change. Even solely supporting the climate change cause with all other conservative views brought South Carolina incumbent Bob Inglis’s downfall. Incumbents often win elections again with their resource advantages, but it is evident that the argument over climate change can make or break one’s chances. Voters need to be informed on the effects of climate change, and although failing economies may avert doubt into the movement, it is ultimately up to politicians to convince the public to help make changes.

<p>
One of the things I see, notice most of the politicians who watch this documentary, or groups of people who deny climate change especially the republicans remain skeptical or some of them simply ignore the issue and say there is no such thing as them; Don't know what is causing climate change and refuse to answer any questions. As someone who believes in climate change, I find reasons for those who insist that the climate change crisis does not exist. Although the climate/temperature seems to be lower than it was a few years ago, overall it is increasing. Its distrust of scientists, its subversion of scientific research and its doubts about its credibility are not enough to discredit the belief that human activity does not cause global warming at all. Simply saying that it is a political science is not a strong argument, it is just a myth and a myth.
 <br><br>
It is hard for sceptics to believe that they do not have the money, or that the profits they make by continuing to support the use of fossil fuels keep them believing that global warming does not exist. It is difficult to take practical action to solve this problem, which often leads to some costs, people don't want to make any sacrifices, don't want to pay extra taxes and stop their business; But slowly making changes and trying to solve the problem is what really needs to be done. This issue should be just a slogan, used in elections, or congress, or just trying to get people on their side. In fact, rising temperatures are real and pose a threat to future generations.

The film A Climate of Doubt details how climate change "skeptics" in the national government by running a public campaign of misinformation. I put "skeptics" in scare-quotes because I personally highly doubt they believe their own talking points. It's very hard to take these people in good faith when they're taking money from fossil fuel giants by Exxon and the Koch brothers, who hide behind Donorstrust in order to avoid public backlash. 
 <br><br>
Myron Ebell of the Cooler Heads Coalition, along with other climate change deniers, are interviewed for this documentary. They are willing, even happy to detail how they capitalized on the 2008 recession and the Tea Party surge in the Republican Party in order to sow discord, break down the consensus and, most importantly, sway public opinion into believing that there was a debate when there was 97% agreement. They managed to drop belief in the climate crisis in America to about 50%. They make me incandescent with rage to be honest.
 <br><br>
The scientists in the documentary speak about how they were being harassed with everything from threats to constant FOIA requests. Nevertheless, they stick with the facts, conceding that the rise in temperature wasn't always constant, but that picking out a small time span and showing the downward trend was like "going down the up escalator." Even they wish that climate change could be genuinely disproven.
 <br><br>
I would rate this a 10/10, and I would recommend this film to everyone, especially those who are unsure about the information on climate change and have heard from both sides.




</p><hr>


<p>
This film is truly so frustrating to watch to think that these people can somehow so credibly ruin the reputations of very hardworking scientists who are trying to spread the truth about the climate crisis. The climate crisis deniers in this film really present absolutely no evidence to support their claims and it’s ridiculous. At first, I would think they’re crazy for thinking that they can get away with this, but the sad part is that people actually believe them! They want to “discover the science of truth” which is laughable to say the least given that they adamantly refute the point that 97% of scientists believe in climate change without any evidence to do so.
 <br><br>

The methods in which they’re trying to accomplish their mission is also very sleazy and not at all scientific integrity. In the film, they mention the method of “going down the up escalator” where they would select 10 years at a time of climate to find that the climate is cooling as evidence for their arguments is dumb when it shows that overall, it’s warming. They’re simply using parameters to their favor and ignoring the complete, holistic truth of the evidence. In addition, the ClimateGate incident was one of the sleaziest things they could do. I don’t know how these people can live with themselves because clearly this film shows that climate denial isn’t out of ignorance, it’s out of selfish greed.

<p>
Although, the severe results of climate change have made some people endangered, lots of people still do not believe global warming is happening. The change because of carbon dioxide emission is too late to let people feel it. So there are some people still insist that global warming just is a hoax, a hoax of scientists. Fred Singer wants to utilize a graph to disprove global warming. But, his graph changed the actual facts about the warming rate of the world. According to a journal, 97% scientists suggest the real effects of global warming. Some of them may be the friends of scientists or are not specialized on environmental science. The fact of global warming is true. President Obama wanted to implement the cap trade policy. I am so glad to see that the president wants to make some contribution to our planet by policy. But there still are some people who do not want to lose their profits. The planet is our planet. We need to protect it together. I want there are more and more people aware the problem of global warming in the future.

Capitalism is killing us faster than we know it. The shiftiness of our political "leaders" is what is delaying our response to anthropogenic climate change. As to why, no one can be sure, but it could be that fossil fuel companies are lining the pockets of these charlatans. Though fossil fuels provide jobs for many, renewables would provide jobs as well, and create new fields for innovation. Many whose make the argument that it would ruin our economy fail to realize that a switch to renewables would launch a new era of innovation, further improving our planetary health.The most frustrating part, though is that four years ago, politicians were for climate reconciliation. However, the pendulum swung back, and now we have regressed to addressing climate change with ambiguity.

A climate of Doubt explores the other side of the climate crisis debate in which the skeptics believe climate change is not human caused. In the film many of the people interviewed had no factual evidence to disprove the climate crisis. They instead criticized other factors which created doubt. Like Ken said many of these skeptics are backed by the big oil corporations which would be scarred by the restrictment of fossil fuel extraction. These companies donate money or back certain organizations which set out to misguide the people on climate science. They also have the ability to donate money through donors trust which is all anonymous and cant hurt them politically. This is completely immoral as it only works towards an agenda which disputes the correlation between climate change and human action. Humans have contributed to climate change, this sentence really comes down to common sense and the common sense is that the only thing on this planet which could affect the climate at a major level would be the human beings who inhabit it. Climate change is the warming of the earth; green house gasses warms the earth in the atmosphere by trapping heat; Humans emit CO2 by use of trains, cars, etc..; CO2 has increased by 100ppm in just 60 years; Fossil fuel demand and use has increased exponentially and the burning of fossil fuels releases CO2. All these previous statements adds up to climate change being a real thing happening to this world yet the skeptics are more focused on the economic side of climate control for a valid reason as well. The colonies that deny the climate crisis are the ones that would end up losing billions of dollars. I believe some skeptics truly believe climate change is a hoax but this belief is due to the misguided education about climate change. When considering the facts its hard to say climate change isn't real.

This film successfully built up the timeline of the government’s shift in its attitude towards change in policies about climate change. It showed clips of speeches about climate change 4 years before it’s filmed and from speeches at the time of the film. Clearly all the politicians had a sharp turn in their words. They used to point out that climate change is due to human activities and we need to change our policies to slow down the process. But now, they tend to use ambiguous words such as “we’re not sure where climate change comes from” and to avoid changes in current policies.
 <br><br>

If I have to think of a reason. They may be aware of the effect of climate change, but they don’t want any changes happen to the current economy. I like this film because it talked about a relatively sensitive topic—politics, especially capitalism. The current situation is more like “we can’t question capitalism and politicians can’t sign policies if they affect the free market”. This film dares to question the government and legislators in this film.
 <br><br>

I wasn’t surprised about the film, but from an emotional aspect, I felt really sorry for the environmental issue that we raised. I saw a comment by someone on climate change before, and it says ‘” Sorry kid, we couldn’t save this planet from climate change because it’s too expensive” this is what we tell our grandchildren’. Basically, I agree that climate change is caused by human beings, but I am also fully aware that solving the problem will cost simply too much that we don’t have much to do for now. Indeed, people are selfish and most of us only care about our own interests. But maybe I can just do a little more to save the climate a little bit. For example, recycle more or ride a bike instead of driving a car.

"A Climate of Doubt" is truly a disturbing film to watch; it doesn't have anything gruesome, brutal, or violent pertaining to it, but its level of sheer buffoonery is gross for the most part, watching politicians use their power to deny climate change in order to boost their political standings. It's yet another example of American politicians being corrupt (which shouldn't really be surprising at this point, but this movie provides yet another way politicians choose to lie about things). The most dangerous thing about this film is that it proves a lot of people will believe lies and misinformation spread around about climate change simply because a politician says it. The film made me feel annoyed at the politicians who were not taking the weight of climate change seriously, and actively working to diminish its importance to the public eye. It made me reconsider all of the politicians that I have supported in the past, and definitely has made me more attentive to the ones who are being considered for the election of 2020.

I was truly set off by the film "Merchants of Doubt" because of how easily these industries can confuse the public through straight denial and "uncertainty." I'm sure we've all grown up with the memory of the tobacco industry. My family was one that fell victim to the cigarette/tobacco industry. This industry constantly used the excuse that they "didn't know the effects of tobacco usage." Big Tobacco would use any excuse they could find to dance around the truth behind their products. The cost of it was the health of tobacco users who fell for the excuses spoon fed to them, and for what? A buck in the pocket of these big tobacco companies? It's the same type of concept today with the fossil fuel industries. They are threatening to destroy our very existence on Earth, for what? A buck in their pocket. Notice how silly that seems. The idea that they would throw away the world for money. They will do anything they can, even if that means mass manipulation, to keep the revenue coming in. I find it very pathetic that this is how our world has ended up like.



</p><hr>


<p>
Both of these films were infuriating. I haven't watched Climate of Doubt completely since last quarter, but when I played the beginning of it and remembered the opening scene, all of the feelings about I had about it came rushing back in. Merchants of Doubt covered a lot of the same topics as the former film, but it still made me just as angry. I simply don't understand why climate change deniers are so adamant about refuting scientific facts. Even if anthropogenic climate change was proven to be false, wouldn't people want to try to keep the planet as healthy as they could? Wouldn't they want to take these tips to stop increasing carbon emissions, pollution, and just the overall destruction of the Earth?
 <br><br>
I enjoyed the comparison that Merchants of Doubt set up of how magic tricks -- illusion and distraction -- used similar tactics as climate deniers. And, just like magic tricks, they manage to fool people. I think it is incredibly irresponsible for politicians to ignore the large amount of evidence supporting anthropogenic climate change. They refuse to listen to facts or be open minded about their opinions on this important topic. I don’t understand how deniers think that scientists and activists are making climate change up. What do they think that we will get out of it? Living sustainably can be difficult and inconvenient at times, so do they think that we would be doing it if it hasn’t proven to benefit the Earth?

<p>
It is no surprise to me that the Fossil Fuel Industry is using the same strategy to deny that humans are causing climate change just as the Tobacco Industry did the same when fighting the science that clearly showed that smoking cigarettes can cause cancer. Last winter quarter in my Science and the Modern World Class, I read the book, Merchants of Doubt where the authors Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway explored how a handful of industries paid scientists and recruited allies to fight against the science of the depletion of the ozone layer, smoking tobacco causing cancer, Nuclear Winter, and finally Climate Change. There were others as well, but the main point I am trying to make is that this is not the first time this has happened as was mentioned in the film, A Climate of Doubt. 
 <br><br>


A general theme and goal is to cast doubt upon the subject that way they can deceive the public, halting any progress to make a change because everyone is skeptical about whether anything should be done or not. It is jeopardizing everyone because every amount of time being wasted will result in severe negative consequences along the line. I find it disheartening that the science of this issue has become political and has become an issue that has an “opinion” and different “sides.” This is just simply wrong—no doubt about it. You can't just turn a topic among a group of scholars who have all pretty much come to a consensus that something is happening into an argument. There is no room for debate at all. It would be different if the climate scientists were divided about the issue, but when you have a whopping 97% of them agree that it is happening, you can’t deny. You do not have a seat at the table to make an argument because this is not your field of study.

The scientists being attacked for their work and being attacked personally makes me angry because they’re just doing what they love and they have made a commitment and are devoting their lives to this. Yet people are constantly attacking them and discrediting their work and their credentials. This reminds me of Rachel Carson being attacked for publishing her Silent Spring when she had done all of the research to back up her claims and showing what was happening. I honestly wonder what goes through people’s minds, like do they think these scientists are just pulling their ideas out of a hat and saying, “Hey, let’s go with this idea because it makes us money.” No, they’re doing this because they care about our planet and all of its life. They want to save the planet. What is also funny is that climate deniers are not providing their own research or providing an alternative reason as to the abnormal weather patterns. This is so disheartening and something must be done about this and soon before it is too late.

While watching this film, I couldn't help but be surprised. I knew that there were people that
didn't believe in climate change but I didn't realize how many people that consisted of. The
countless organizations and conferences that are based solely off of trying to prove that climate
change doesn't exist is disturbing to me. I am curious as to what makes people truly believe that
climate change is a hoax and doesn't pose a problem in our world. Because if thousands of
scientists have spent decades collecting data on climate change, what possible reasons could
there be that climate change isn't real? The fact that these organizations refuse to believe, and
come up with their own explanations as to why human impact has not made a difference in the
climate, is disappointing.

It was so interesting when I heard about some politicians deny climate change and claim that 97% of scientist who advocated for this issue “deluded”. It is well known that our planet is suffering unprecedented global warming and it is probably irreversible. Those scientists that support this fallacy also got instrumental record of temperature in recent years and observed long-term trend from that but they just picked the last ten years saying “there hasn’t been a warming”. How ridiculous their words were! Therefore, I began to wonder why they self-cheated waging people’s ally of protests. Apart from a fact that there is no effective action to stop climate change, these politicians who are against cap-and-trade think about their related free enterprise. At the same time, citizens who question climate change lost job because of cap-and-trade, so they form this collective which claims that climate change is a hoax of government to increase taxes and kill jobs. However, those proven scientific data literally tell the truth that the whole temperature has been moving up to a large extent and things behind are protestors’ selfishness at the cost of descendants’ living environment. Such a serious environmental problem became a wager of many politicians’ stances but actually it means a lot more than politically win. Luckily, there are wise people and they pointed out disasters results of increasing sea level would not go away just because some people legislate them away. I am for 97% of scientists and believe that they could come up with certain actions to curb climate change so that we can have a brighter future.

I stand with you and 97% scientists who think global warming is causing serious problems for future generations. I am shocked when I found some “researchers” think global warming is not largely caused by humans. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is totally unnecessary. They argue that the rising sea level will stop finally. However, it’s impossible for global warming to stop if we humans continue polluting the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. Many people oppose government’s action for climate changes because they are afraid of unemployment brought by cap-and-trade policy. This policy is misunderstood as increasing tax posed by governors. Maybe climate changes did not influence people too much at that time. But if you look at wildfires happening around the world, you will realize how severe it is. In the movie, many people point out that why Vice President still choose to fly private jets after doing so much for climate changes. They might think global warming is just a political game, but this is actually a problem that all of us should not ignore it. For our generations, for other life in the world, we should always fight for climate changes.

Skeptical attitude about the hop topic climate change and global warming is really convincing in this film with a logical and supportive process to convince people that so called “global warming” is purely a political action instead of scientific fact. With all the political information to prove the main theme, I feel frustrated because they people some happening facts are “cooked”. Although argument of such hot topic need ideas and discussions from both sides, but the film indicates global warming is misstatement might worsen the current situation. Will developing countries still exchanging environment to wealth and finally leave the people with extreme climate events? The economical gain is important, and the pursuit of prosperity is a more certain thing than climate issues with “uncertainties”.

this is a film that talks about the actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. He went over the world to find the effect caused by global warming. this is a documentary talked about to save our planet. the planet is our home. Everyone needs to protect this planet. no one can survive if the planet has died. In the documentary, you are going to see a worldwide tour of diverse ecological systems. When you watch the film, you will see how does our consumerism causes this disaster. You are going to see evidence of how do our behaviors cause global warming. And the audience will see how serious effects will be caused by global warming with different evidence. And Leonardo DiCaprio uses his influence to make people pay attention to global warming. I love this film a lot. This film makes people know that we can't ignore global warming anymore. We have to envisage global warming. If we want our children can still live on this beautiful planet, we have to protect it. Please protect our planet!

After watching A Climate of doubt, I am better informed on the dark side of climate change. Never have I thought about that there could be a group of people advocating against climate change. The confidence in the words and facial expressions of one of the interviewees further astonished me. There was no one single doubt in words the scientist has said, and we can see that he backs his belief strongly. Moving into the documentary, I was getting a bigger picture of the issue. There is a significant amount of scholars and celebrities and most importantly, some portion of the general public believes that human-caused global warming is not real. The backers of this belief mostly had one incentive--profit. The general public wants less restriction on certain work fields; the president wants a better economy for the country, and the oil giants want less governmental tax. 
 <br><br>

According to scientific data, earth is indeed warming up, a change in temperature could cause numerous after-effects, it is reasonable to make projections about rising sea levels and submerging cities. Whether it is caused by humans or not, we have to deal with it. But I fear the very nature of humans might cause the problem to escalate even more. People are greedy and typically don't think ahead, forward-thinking is not inherent in us, it is learned, plus the fact that most people struggle with delayed gratification, I cannot help but worry about our future.

I finished watching this film with an overwhelming feeling of frustration and a newfound understanding of selfishness. People who allow bribery to command their actions and dictate the way they educate are selfish. Maybe this is because America is built on the basis of capitalism, and money is the most important focus to most people. Success is so deeply rooted in the idea of individual gain, that people are unwilling to forfeit the importance of the environment for a new car or better branded clothes. The quote, "The major funders of the climate counter-movement are ideologically driven foundations that are very much concerned about conservative values and world views" really stuck with me. This is again an idea of selfishness. People don't only place their financial views in the realm of their work for the greater public, but also place their ideological ideas above everyone else's. I understand that differing ideologies create conflict, but the scientific evidence of a warming planet shouldn't be debated based on the way a person thinks.

After watching the film Climate of Doubt, I was shocked at the amount of people who still refuse to believe that climate change is a myth. Especially after taking a class on global warming class last year, I was able to understand the proven effects of global warming on our environment and how it has been increasing faster in the last decade than it has hundreds of years ago. The very idea that there are politicians who don’t believe in climate change and hold powerful positions in government is scary. It is absurd that these people who were interviewed in the film say that the best thing to do now is to wait and see, however, the problem with waiting is that our emissions from ten years ago are going to catch up with us now and the emissions we make now will catch up with us anytime soon in the future. John Hockenberry, the frontline correspondent of the film does an exceptional job exposing skeptics which allows viewers to see that we humans are the center of the problem. Overall, my response to this film is more emotional rather than intellectual because I already understand the processes and effects of climate change, however it still makes me sad and disgusted people refuse to believe it.

The film interviews scientists, lobbyists and politicians to explain how deception works from the perspective of magicians.
 <br><br>
97% of scientists confirmed that climate change is mainly caused by human activities. Large polluting companies such as American oil have inherited the tricks of tobacco companies, hired lobbyists to disguise themselves as professionals to form a third-party organization to confuse the public, publicized different reasons to make the facts recognized by the global scientific community seem controversial, or intimidated the public to "protect a free life style", turning scientific issues into political issues. Some lobbyists were employed at different times Many different pollution industries, lobbyists even happily admit their distorted psychology in the film. After admitting that climate change has polluted the operation of Koch group and Mobil Oil, the most serious group in the United States, Republican leaders denied climate change. A conscientious conservative Republican was elected by Republican voters because he took seriously and believed in the conclusions of mainstream scientists and called for action to deal with climate change.
 <br><br>
It is a moral issue that science should not allow capital to influence results. I've been concerned about climate change and tobacco control for many years, and I'm still depressed. It took the United States 50 years to make it clear that smoking is a serious health hazard. Through the internal information of tobacco companies, those responsible for tobacco are punished. However, if the greenhouse gases are allowed to cover the atmosphere for 50 years, human beings may not have a chance.

The 2012 film "A Climate of Doubt" did a fantastic job of chronologically displaying the progressive events in the climate change movement, as well as its regression by way of backlash from the fossil fuel industry, drawing a close similarity to that of the tobacco industries v.s. medical opinion in the 1960's. The point of this film really wasn't to vilify the fossil fuel companies, but to simply illustrate two sides of an argument, although clearly exposing the validity of the other as less credible. The narrator of the film pointed out that fossil fuel companies are acting on financial interests, which is what caused the backlash after the threat of a bipartisan push against climate change in the early 2000's. My first impressions of this film was that it dissected the arguments against climate change and asserted a more credible reputation from climate change believers. But I was shocked to learn that a movement once supported by both parties in the U.S. became a controversial topic removed from the mouths of popular political figures. I feel hopeless, I feel angry, I feel frustrated, but most of all I feel disappointed. There is a crisis of honesty that impedes us to do what is right. And the more videos I watch from this class, the less faith I have in the future of this planet.

After watching “ A Climate of Doubt”, I watched “ Merchants of Doubt and I surely know deeper about the power behind the scenes is so influential. We need to think deeper about the details behind and what the power is trying to show and hide. We need to think about how personal interests as a motivation can push people to care and consider in a different way. From the cigarettes companies that the film mentions, how they promote and the purposes behind it is interesting. Moreover, promoting a thing is not really about convincing a thing, it’s about let most of the people know this thing and then spread it all over, which does effective, but whether this action is ethical is still debatable.
 <br><br>

People nowadays actually know that to save the planet, 85% of coal, 35% of oil, and 52% of natural gas need to be reserved, which is strongly against companies’ benefits. So as a result, they are pushing in the back politically and secretly for the purpose of confusing humans whether climate changes are because of us. From all those video, I felt the smallness and how narrow human beings can be, meanwhile it reflects how we can change and change the others towards bigger goals.

I found "Merchants of Doubt"  to be very interesting, especially so in the very beginning which highlighted the parallels between the tobacco industry and the fossil fuel industry. I found it particularly frustrating how both Seitz and Singer turned their back on science in order serve their political ideology and began attacking issues that involve a need for government action. This film perfectly exemplifies how climate change became politicized and how divisive the issue has been in the past 10 years alone. The most shocking part of the film however was seeing how radically politicians retracted their previous statements on climate change. Initially I found it promising to see Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich as a united front acknowledging the climate crisis but seeing how just years later republican views were completely changed was disheartening. 
 <br><br>
 Although many republicans chose to take a climate denial stance, I applaud Bob Inglis for recognizing the science behind climate change and realigning his beliefs based on the evidence he saw first hand. Moreover, it is difficult for me to understand that people genuinely believe you cannot be considered conservative if you believe in climate change. The fact that some people think the denial or belief in climate change dictates whether you are conservative or not is so utterly backwards and goes to show how polarizing this issue has become. I think Inglis was also correct in asserting that some people consider this an attack on their lifestyle, unwilling to change. The thing is, this crisis demands change and if people choose to follow through with that change, the positive effects of this newly adopted lifestyle will become plainly clear.

If referring to the effectiveness of the film A Climate of Doubt I would say it was extremely effective at frustrating its audience, including myself. To watch this film 7 years later is interesting but, it is hard to watch as skeptics of global warming shut down every ounce of scientific evidence proposed about climate change. Even more frustrating is to know that some still think this way today. Personally, wanting to pursue a career in environmental policy and attempt to help our planet as much as one can, this film pains me to see and hear the opinions of those that are anti-climate change. As a firm believer in climate change and the reality of our global crisis the need for environmental protection and enforcement is more than ever before. At the rate we are going now, bipartisanship should be the least of our worries. We should be making progress in global policy regardless of all other political issues. As humans we have a duty to our home that has provided for us for millions of years. We should be making personal choices in our everyday lives and diets as well as major changes in our towns, cities, and counties to insight the change we so desperately need. 
 <br><br>

Most importantly as my generation approaches the times in our lives where we will begin our careers it is very important that we step up and begin the changes the world needs to see. We have a responsibility to pick up the slack of our parents and grandparents and save our planet. While I would love to recommend this film to a friend to further motivate them in their personal journey fighting for our planet I believe I would rather recommend this film to some who are uneducated and need to see this film. In doing so, I believe the more that this film is recommended to those who need to see it the further our reach can be. There are no excuses for the complacency of the past generations in all walks of life but with the help of our knowledge and our drive I believe in the next couple decades we can truly make a difference. To be frank, climate change is not a hoax and is caused by human activity. We have made this mess and we must clean it up-literally and theoretically.

After watching a climate of doubt, I am appalled, and honestly a little scared, at the viewpoints and opinions of all the politicians and scientists who are denying that climate change is occurring.  The way that they flat out denied facts, often in a smug way made me pretty mad.  It seemed that most of the politicians and scientists that are denying the impact of human activity on climate change are doing so out of pure opinion, and flat out refusing to believe the facts obtained from research even when it is right in front of them,  The fact that some of the scientists were refusing to acknowledge facts and evidence, or only look at one small aspect that seemed to support their claim (like when they only took data from a 10-year segment on the graph of temperatures, when clearly if you looked at the graph as a whole there was a significant overall increase in temperature) was appalling to me.  What's even sadder about this whole situation is that these politicians are being paid by the fossil fuel companies to flat out deny what they could know is the truth, how can some people be so selfish? It was also very scary to see how much the media can manipulate and twist words around, like when one of the scientists brought up that over 30,000 other scientists had signed a petition denying climate change, but then it was brought up that anyone with a B.A. had access to it, and there were even celebrities that had signed it.  I think growing up in California I wasn't really exposed to some of the more conservative viewpoints that other parts of the country possess, but I didn't realize that there is such a huge quantity of Americans who possess this viewpoint and can just flat out deny that climate change is occurring, even with all of the data and evidence that is so easily accessible.  It was also very annoying that most of the people who supported this claim were predominantly old, white men.  I feel that the younger generation is more aware of the current global issues and hopefully, we can begin standing up for the earth and making a significant change in the world.

Climate of doubt works to expose the politics behind climate change and the absurdity of skepticism in the act of global warming. The PBS film shows the difference of opinions between republicans and democrats in the united states  government. Watching this film didn't enlighten me or surprise me too much but it got me thinking  about the different ways the government can manipulate people economically and socially. Economically the government can manipulate us by raising or lowering prices based on scientific findings, whether they be true or not; even neglecting to consider the environmental cost of our products. . Socially, like the case in North Carolina, the town representatives choose to ignore scientific findings about rising sea levels and are just going to ignore the fact that whole neighborhoods could  end up underwater in the near future. It scares me that so many people could deny climate change and trust obviously incorrect science.

In our long believe of that global warming is mostly cost by human activities. However after watching the film "A Climate of Doubt", I find that in political debates years ago, climate change could be proven as a nonissue to the planet. I feel angry. It is ridiculous that scientific data was ignored and misunderstood. A lot of people mistakenly thought the scientific stats about global warming was hyped, and various of measures to protect the environment were actually unnecessary. In fact, it was all controlled by government organizations. They determined global warming did not affect the Earth at all—carbon even is the food of the planet—because they would lose great amount of profits due to prevent causing pollutions and  overusing resources. They believed making more money is much more important than protecting the Earth. The largest argument that supported them was that Earth is strong as a planet. It could recover by itself as the time passes, so human beings even do not need to help it to recover. Compared with the scientists who produced the actual data, the political figures had a strong tie which they can produce “real” data and statements according to a small group of people. I feel worried that official data could be easily compiled. I think the film did a great job in transporting the information of two-sides of climate facts produced in scientific data center and political organizations.

After watching "Climate of Doubt", I was really frustrated how people are being manipulated. Denying climate change is not only stupid but dangerous. But the companies that sponsor climate denial simply have too much to lose, and I don't really expect them to do anything different. It was also interesting to see how intimately politics is tied to the issue. 
 <br><br>
How is any progress going to be made if lawmakers continue to deny the effects of climate change? This documentary was just another example of how politicians are failing not just America, but the world.

<p>
It is frustrating to me the extent to which these climate change deniers are willing to go to manipulate Americans into confusion. Climate change has become such a political and polarized issue that creating this culture of doubt around it has enabled the goals of the fossil fuel industry to be achieved. People are not acting because they are unsure and they are unsure because these deceiving and manipulative tactics are infiltrating American minds. It is crazy to see the roles that money, power, and corruption play in this campaign. People that know the issue of climate change is a real crisis are able to see through these scare tactics, yet people that are not as well educated on the issue are less able to question it. When Fred Singer stated, “Climate is a non-issue… It will change no matter what we do” I felt annoyed. His background as a physicist and an emeritus professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia lends credibility to his ridiculous argument so people are less inclined to challenge it. Yet as we saw in the film, he has ties to the fossil fuel industry. These tactics need to be questioned and challenged from every angle. 
 <br><br>

It’s hard to feel anything more than anger and irritation at both the book “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming” and the film. These tactics are powerful because they are working to achieve the goal of inaction/delay. Which as we have learned, we do not have time for. The response to being wrong on climate change is appalling, yet not unpopular. I have had a conversation with someone that denies climate change and basically said that even if it is happening, he wouldn’t be around to deal with the impacts. That really bothered me because that is similar to how these people with close connections to the fossil fuel industry feel. Myron Ebell’s response that he would be “Sorry” if skeptics were wrong about climate change truly highlights the distance and indifference these people feel toward the impacts of climate change. Their lack of empathy comes from their belief that they will not be personally impacted. Yet as we know, everyone will be impacted.

If we had an ounce of what these big oil companies spend to promote such utter nonsense, the world would be in a much different position right now. Watching this film has made me feel a great sense of hopelessness. There are a plethora of studies by acclaimed scientists that prove that anthropogenic climate change is real and that the effects are already taking place, yet these greedy selfish conglomerates choose to instead give the microphone and cash to those that outright deny it. I really loved the analogy given by Bob Ingils when he compares this climate change “debate” to that of a mother deciding how to treat her child when given two options. Hearing Christopher Monckton deny climate change and call it a hoax with his smug grin just enraged me further. The mental gymnastics that these individuals will go through to continuously deny something that is so vivid in our world today is asinine. I remember hearing someone in the film state that CO2 is a good thing and that all life and plants depend on it, so that it’s fine. Water is a thing that we all depend on as well, but you don’t see people pumping their bodies to such extremities with it. I don’t understand Fred Singer’s logic in this film when he outright states that climate change is natural and that we have to just “wait a little.” Wait for what exactly? For our species to die out and go extinct because we did nothing to solve the problems that we caused? This isn’t one of those problems where it will just magically fix itself if we choose to turn a blind eye. It’s almost the same logic as providing “thoughts on prayers” on certain tragedies instead of actually doing something. As much as this film infuriated me, I believe that it is important and that it should be shown as a means to educate people of what we are up against when it comes to fighting for our planet.

<p>
The film “A Climate of Doubt" introduced a different perspective. Unlike the other films, we see from the viewpoint of climate change deniers. It was interesting to see the different ways people were trying to suppress the truth and the excuses they would make to convince themselves that the climate crisis was not real. Scientists struggled to convince people that climate change is a result of human activity mainly because politicians influenced the public into thinking there is doubt behind their studies. It seems hopeless when the people who have the power to change the climate crisis believe that there is no problem in the first place.
 <br><br>
I have seen "Merchants of Doubt" in a previous class and this film shows how companies will try to suppress the truth from the public in order to continue making profit. For instance, the film talked about the tobacco industry and how they did not want to reveal the harmful effects they have on the human body. It is the same with fossil fuel companies in which their interests are only in making profit.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching “Climate of Doubt” I feel frustrated because of how efficient the efforts of certain groups were in tarnishing the validity of climate change. Within the scientific community there’s a consensus of 97% of scientists who recognize that climate change is occurring and that it is man made, however, people like Fred Singer who is one of only thousands of people who actively deny that the climate is changing and that people are responsible for it continue to spread dangerous information. It becomes even more frustrating when you learn some of the people making these claims aren’t even qualified to do so, which you can see with the Oregon list where people just needed a bachelors of science to add themselves as climate deniers. 
 <br><br>
The push against climate change was fueled by people protecting industry with many politicians accepting funds from fossil fuel industries. The misinformation created invalidated the science and caused many people, as a result, to believe climate change is a hoax. Climate change also became an issue dividing political parties and it became viewed as a liberal issue with supporters being accused of being pro government and anti free market. Watching the documentary it seemed like the climate change denial was only prevalent among the Republican Party with anyone who supported climate change being outcasted. Politicians such as Inglis, an incumbent who publicly said climate change was happening because of human activity was voted out during his own primary. This shows us how deeply connected politics and climate change are and the only way we can prepare for climate change is through new policies which are difficult to make with how polarized Congress became on the issue. It seems like what the deniers did, worked.

<p>
Watching the documentary “A Climate of Doubt” was so infuriating that I had to pause it half way through and take a 10 minute walk around my house trying to fathom how people can be so incredibly selfish. It just reinforced the parts about our American government that I dislike the most; the money-hungry, privileged, disrespectful white men in power that use their powerful platforms to brainwash the uneducated people of America and inject them with their greedy viewpoints. It made me very grateful that I am receiving such a good education and that I am curious and informed enough to not blindly follow anything that politicians say. 

 <br><br>

It makes no sense to me that these people are willing to destroy our planet just to put more money in their pockets. Actually, it does make a little sense, since they are old farts that will probably die before they see the worst of what will happen to the Earth as a result of climate change. 
 <br><br>


One part of the documentary that intrigued me was when Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist, stated that “the perception is often that climate scientists are ‘godless, tree-hugging liberals out to suck all the money out of the average person and use it to fund all this [global warming] research.” This view that climate deniers have, labeling climate scientists as money suckers struck me as so ironic considering the motives behind the actions of climate deniers in power tends to be monetary gain.

<p>
After watching the film, “A Climate of Doubt”, I was left very angry and sad. I find it ridiculous that there are still people out there ignoring the changes and proof that’s right in front of them. Instead of opening their eyes, they choose to see what benefits them and decides to paint that as the true version of the picture. It’s extremely saddening to see scientists put in time and effort to do research to help the Earth, and get trashed on for it. They don’t deserve to be questioned 24/7 for wanting to help.
 <br><br>

Watching the part where the climate change deniers get questioned was extremely frustrating. Seeing them dodge the truth is scary. However, the part of the film that stressed me out the most was when the retired physicist Fred Singer was giving his speech. He stated that “There’s nothing wrong with the climate. It’ll change no matter what we do. It’ll get colder. It’ll get warmer. We just have to wait a little”.  The truth of the matter is, we don’t have any time to “wait a little”. The fact that people still don’t understand this is worrisome. We have to accept that this problem was not naturally made, it happened because of humans. We have to act now, there is no time to keep denying it.



</p><hr>


<p>
The film “A Climate of Doubt” was seriously frustrating to watch. I was annoyed and angered by the fact that there really are people out there that strongly believe climate change is not real. There is so much evidence behind it, yet people still find ways to discredit the issue which astonishes me. Science is not an alternative fact. Skeptics’ arguments are very insufficient. They don’t have much evidence to back up their claims and in fact manipulated credible sources and information into supporting their argument. Due to their manipulation, progress towards a sustainable future here in the U.S. was put to a halt. In the film it was mentioned that there was a general agreement between both political parties that climate change was an issue that needed to be dealt with. But during the 2008 recession, skeptics took advantage of the situation by influencing the public, feeding them ideas that efforts towards a greener America will only “hurt” the people and only strengthen their argument that Global warming is a hoax. It’s just sad to hear that we could’ve solved this problem sooner



</p><hr>


<p>
What stood out most from "A Climate of Doubt" was the hypocrisy from the climate skeptics. They were extremely accusatory of those trying to address the crisis. Claims of doing it with  the intent to help renewable energy companies are unfounded and ultimately harmful. The damage that is going to be done by climate change will affect millions of lives in the near future and billions not long after. We as a civilization have fundamentally damaged the very system that allowed us to evolve and thrive. On the timescale of the planet we have been here a blip and the continued choice by fossil fuel companies to pursue money over everything is horrible. The lack of empathy and care shown by Myron Ebell was chilling. Creating political and social conflict over an issue that needs unity to be solved is a moral disaster and is going to harm so many people. The tactics of manipulating data truly stands against everything climate scientists are working toward.

I found the story of Scientists Katherine Hayhoe and Andrew Dessler particularly interesting. These are two professional people going about their lives and trying to make the world better, who just get chosen by a “roll of the dice” by ATI. It seems so random and unbelievable, like tabloid reporters scraping the bottom of the barrel for dirt. Punishing scientists and writers from doing their job and collaborating with other sources is counterproductive and (I find) morally reprehensible. The free spread of information should be encouraged and applauded. Independent parties should not try to intimidate people into not spreading information. Without the free flow of science and knowledge, people can never learn or form their own opnions. Information becomes a privlidge rather than an accesible right, and the country leaps backward. To punish these scientists for doing good is a slap in the face to anyonr who believes that people have the right to an education and the right to transparent information. 
 <br><br>
 However the personal reactions these two scientists gave is what really got to me. Katherine Hayhoe was shocked, and seemed a bit offended by the charges. She pointed out that climate change is believed by a wide variety of groups and brought up her own faith stating, “My faith is integral to who I am. That's what defines me, not what I do on a day-to-day basis. And so when I study the planet, I feel as if I'm studying something that God created.” Besides being a lovely quote, it shows  just how personal an attack on her work was. This is an unbiased woman doing “pro-bono” writing to help others. And Dessler’s comment, that the temporary misfortune of having to deal with the ATI and FOIA requests on him was nothing compared to what may happen in “50 years or 100 years or 200 years.” As a scientest he knows it’s his job and duty to be transparent about his findings and warn people. His view is selfless, and I admire it greatly.

Climate of Doubts analyzes how Climate change has fallen  off the frontline of political discourse. Despite an overwhelming amount of research and data surrounding climate change, and an even larger amount of climate scientists who believe that climate change is indeed real, doubt is cast over the public by groups who believe that the climate crisis is fake. Theses groups portrays scientists and politicians as liars and conspirators. They believe that politicians rely on almarist views on climate change and the focus around global warming is purpley political. They focus on denying the consensus between scientists due to a lack of understanding of the science behind climate change.  Fred Singer states, “There is nothing wrong with climate, it will change no matter what we do.” The climate crisis is portrayed as false, potentially giving rise to the devastating consequences of climate change. 
 <br><br>
Journalist Hockenberry asks lawmaker if he believed that global warming has been caused by human beings and he responds “partially.” Hockenberry then asks if he still feels this way, despite 97 percent of scientists finding that climate change is mostly due to human activity and he states that they are entitled to their opinion. One would think that the individuals who disagree with climate change will have sufficient evidence in doing so being that there is such a high amount of research and scientists who have acknowledged the detriment of the problem as well as the catastrophic potential that it holds. The evidence used to support their views is merely non-existent. Two senators based their views on little to no scientific basis, with one believing what makes “good sense” and the other approaching the entire climate debate from a “commonsense standpoint.” The lack of scientific support in these perspectives reflects the self-interested roots of these decisions. The wellbeing of the planet and its inhabitants are not prioritized at all. Plus these outlooks are held by senators and lawmakers, individuals whose job is to  look after the wellbeing of the public on a daily basis. It is actually scary to know that there are people in office whose intentions are not pure or motivated by maintaining and promoting a healthy society.

Going into "Climate of Doubt," I was aware of just how little I knew about the other perspective in the battle for curbing climate change, the minority that can be simply referred to as skeptics that are extremely hard to find in California, an extremely blue state overall, despite having grown up in one of the state's few conservative counties; in fact, the only constant source of climate change skepticism in my life has originated from my conservative family members in Kentucky. Despite having heard their denials, I never bothered to understand their reasoning since they were heavily outmatched scientifically. Because of this, I greatly appreciate the work Frontline has done to faithfully represent both sides of the conversation, with the main focus of the documentary being on the well-known skeptics that integrate the perpetuation of falsehoods with their livelihoods. Compared to the other climate documentaries we've watched, this by far was the most informative in my opinion; I truly believe that one can only make a decision for themselves regarding debated issues after fairly hearing both sides, free of any bias or judgment. 

 <br><br>

Never in a million years would I have thought that both Al Gore and the last American recession would have such a profound impact on adding pure gasoline to the fire of climate-change skepticism. Legislation such as cap-and-trade that passed in Congress initially was later demonized and portrayed by climate change deniers that "cap and trade will slow the economy and cost American jobs," two things any American would despise hearing, myself included, if only if were an actual fact and not political slander aimed directly at the left. Before I was very surprised that climate change was a divisive, partisan issue, but now that reality makes perfect sense; had the recession not been as severe, or if it had happened under a Republican president and administration instead, skeptics would have had to solely rely on their smear campaign of Al Gore to galvanize the general American public into blanket denial. I fear that history may repeat itself since recessions operate on a cycle, albeit not a very predictable one. With the period of economic expansion we currently see ourselves in be partially due to a Republican president as controversial as Donald Trump being in office troubles me greatly now because of the fact that if the American people elect a Democratic president and the economy spirals into a recession under their term, conservatives will immediately blame the left for once again trying to further a "bogus" liberal agenda that hurt the economy too much, a big chunk of said agenda being climate change advocacy. Should this occur, climate change legislation key to somewhat placing us on track to curb our climate footprint will be dead on arrival, a win for skeptics and the fossil fuel industry and ultimately, a major loss and disappointment for every future American that has yet to be born into our corrupted democracy.

When watching "A Climate of Doubt" I couldn't help but feel angry that they were denying that climate change is real and insulting those who believed in it. I remember them saying that another word for climate change is bull shit. Yet these same people who say that climate change is a hoax are not reliable because they are not scientists or people who know anything about this issue. 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real and is mostly human caused, meaning we can stop its rate by changing our habits. Even though most scientists agree people still try to deny that it is real by saying, "what do we know about it?". It's frustrating because scientists are the people who study this and are the one that know about it and yet they are not being taken seriously. Something else that caught my attention was when they started talking about Fred Upton. Fred Upton became a chairman of the House of Energy Committee and when he became chairman his stance on climate change, changed. In the past, he acknowledged climate change as a problem and after becoming chairman he refused to answer if it was human caused. This is interesting because he is not the only person who refuses to answer, members of Congress also refuse to answer. This is due to fossil fuel interests, a lot of members of government benefit from these fossil fuel companies so of course they don't want to say climate change is being caused by this or else they would not be able to benefit. The main reason that people in government don't care or see the importance of acting right now is that it is not a threat to them, but a threat to future generations

One of the most striking facts that was presented early on in this film, Climate of Doubt, was that the number of people who believe that climate change is man-made has dropped to half of what it originally was. Hearing that was particularly upsetting because it is crazy to think that while on one hand we are trying to motivate people into action against the climate crisis, there is a countermovement that is actively and successfully working to take people we thought were on our side and making them doubt that this is even an issue. After seeing how easy it is to skew the graphs to make it look like we have been experiencing overall cooling rather than warming, it is not hard to believe that the opposing side of this debate has the means to manipulate the data in many ways and skew public opinion. 

 <br><br>

The anti-climate change movement seems to take small points, such as a brief trends of cooling temperatures and out-of-context emails that did not affect any data, and blow them completely out of proportion in order to create a false narrative. I believe that Tim Phillips is correct in saying that the best way to counter this narrative and to win this overall debate is to win the science argument. At the end of the day, only scientific evidence can truly fight back against false claims about climate change being a “hoax” and I think we are getting to the point of having so much real-time evidence that the climate crisis will be undeniable soon.



</p><hr>


<p>
I think it's going to be interesting to see the shifts in mentality by the American people once the changes brought about by the climate crisis are undeniable. The film makes the comparison to the Tobacco industry, an industry that capitalizes off of addiction and steadily poisons those who use its product. In the past smoking tobacco products was seen as completely normal and healthy. But now that we know better our perception has changed. I wonder what will be the equivalent for climate change.
 <br><br>

The ability of the fossil fuel companies to influence our government via economic power, lobbying, and spreading false information guised as scientific information is terrifying.  But the fact that we can see the devastating fires in California and Australia, the disappearing shorelines in the Gulf of Mexico, and the increasingly devastating hurricanes and still deny climate change is almost worse. I'd like to tweak the comparison made by Bob Ingils a little bit: 97 doctors are telling us our child is sick, 3 are telling us he's fine, and some people are choosing to believe the 3 despite our child looking pale and coughing up blood.

The film I watched was "Merchants of Doubt" which showed the measures corporations are willing to take to protect themselves from policy change or any form of punishment. The cigarette industry had done so much to help protect themselves like simply lying to Congress and neutralizing their enemies who were seen as the fire department. The lengths they were willing to go are unmeasurable and alarming as the lives of people don't matter, it's always about the dollar signs and gaining more power. But what I didn't know is it's also worrying about having a socialist nation with more government regulation, which to conservatives takes away the free market they love so much. This is a growing problem that will never change until those in power change their morals and begin to consider what matters, which obviously isn't the money. The repetitiveness of there being "no consensus" is so irritating as the facts have been there it honestly just makes those people look foolish. There's just so much progress that needs to be made and it shouldn't be such a challenge, but it is. The new data is reassessed all the time and when the answer doesn't confirm one's bias a lie will be pursued. Debunkers aren't creating solutions, only more distractions that waste more time.

I too, watched the film "Merchants of Doubt" and was appalled by the sinister actions of corporations due to financial incentives and at the expense of the wellbeing of the general public. Through illuminating the parallel tactics used by both the cigarette industry and fossil fuel corporations, the film effectively underscores how the fossil fuel industry has managed to contaminate the public's opinion on the climate catastrophe and the severity of the situation at hand. The more I learn about the ulterior motives of the fossil fuel industry, I become more and more aware of the extent to which corporate greed is ingrained in every aspect of our capitalistic society. It makes me many question things beyond climate change, if policymakers are this easily swayed, confused and paid off to misinform the public on an issue threatening their well-being, than what else are we as a society being wrongfully taught? This question deeply disturbs me.  Moreover, hearing the terrible threats that scientists and public figures received when trying to clarify the true nature of the situation,  profoundly bothered me. Is this how messengers of truth are treated in this day and age? Thankfully, I know that my generation, or at least those who I am surrounded by, are much more open-minded to any and all knowledge. It's time for people to realize that climate change is by no means a political issue whatsoever. It is a crisis threatening all of humanity.

I want to start off by saying that this strategy being used by climate change deniers of creating doubt is a good strategy. As Ken mentioned they want to keep pumping as much money as possible, and creating doubt is only going to buy them more time to do this. This is a smart way for them to go about this because going about it the scientific way with good solid evidence would definitely not work for them. This is clearly seen in the film “A Climate of Doubt”. 
 <br><br>

Both of the films “A Climate of Doubt” and “Merchants of Doubt” aim to combat the doubt that has been created by the climate change deniers. “A Climate of Doubt” goes about it its own way. This film focuses more on making the climate change deniers appearing weak. Their argument is weak, so this was not a hard task to do. “Merchants of Doubt” does that as well but also uses the tobacco industry as a comparison. This film also uses the concept of magic as an analogy, which I thought was brilliant. Both films bring up the Oregon Petition which is one of the main things that make these climate change deniers seem weak. Both films also talk about how this debate is all about politics and money, not about science. This is really frustrating because these climate change deniers are fighting a movement that wants to take care of our planet in exchange for some money. As seen from the tobacco industry and now this it is evident that money will always be the force running things.

As strong as the word is, I genuinely hate seeing very obvious corruption, and there is plenty of it shown the film "A Climate of Doubt". The film was infuriating in the sense that it's all political, political to the point where people are measuring the ecosystem in terms of possible capital/revenue. 
 <br><br>


I constantly day dream about doing "spring cleaning" in the White House. I use the term as a way to portray the removal of the corruptness in the government. Hardly anything is getting passed due to a majority of politicians being on someone else's pay roll. It's like the equivalent of the mafia (big oil industries) paying off the police department (politicians) to give them room to do what they want. I found it idiotic when one politician said CO2 is good. How is it good? Because quote "It is plant food", being completely ignorant to the fact that CO2 creates a greenhouse effect, which results in a warmer climate. 
 <br><br>


These people are so money-hungry that they are willing to destroy the entire planet just for monetary gain, which is quite frankly really stupid because there will be no planet to spend that money. The cherry on top for me in terms of ignorance is when Myron Ebell, one of the more prominent faces in this "anti-climate change" campaign, was asked "What if [he] was wrong?" All he simply responded was with "Then I'm sorry." These are the kinds of people that have politicians, the people with true power for change, on their pay roll. They are willing to risk it all (all is the entire planet) just for their own personal gain. Greed is a huge driving force in this constant - but unnecessary - debate over climate change.

After watching "A Climate of Doubt," I realized how big of a role politics play in the issue of climate change. Politicians are very greedy and will do anything in order to gain support towards their agenda. And the agenda involves denying the existence of climate change. Politics have shown me that individuals involved in such toxic community only care about the money and how successful they are in their careers. However, with such greed and success, there comes a huge cost which is the gradual death of our own planet.  
 <br><br>

And not only politicians are involved in such nonsense, actual scientists are too. Many scientists claim that climate change isn't real with a bunch of scientific facts that go against the existence of climate change. However, because of such efforts, the public is continuing to go under great distress within the degrading environment. If scientists and other people in society don't get it together to improve the environment, I am extremely concerned with not only my own well being but also other people's as well. I hope future generations can find more solutions that can tackle this issue.

There is one clip of Bob Inglis in “The Climate of Doubt” that really stood out to me. He compares the dissenters of human caused climate change to the following: “Your child is sick. 98 doctors says ‘treat him this way’, 2 doctors say that another way is the way to go. You say ‘I will go with the 2’”. This is a powerful comparison, and it really shows the irrationality behind the opposing side. 

 <br><br>

Fred Singer uses one time series graph to show that there is “no warming trend” in the last ten years. However, as said later by other climate scientists, Singer (like many others) can manipulate date and graphs in anyway they want to deliver their side of the argument. With techniques as easy as manipulating the starting point and ending point in a time series, nonbelievers like Singer can change data to show whatever they want. As our world moves more and more forward towards data driven decision making, the effect of these data visualization techniques is dangerous. Imagine showing a seemingly reasonable graph that is shown by Singer, to a group of children. Children will easily believe what Singer has to say, and thus will develop a wrong basis of thoughts as they grow older. It is important that we prevent this from happening. It is important to show accurate data representation, especially when it comes to world threatening events like climate change.

"A Climate of Doubt," was very good at conveying its subject matter, I was unaware of how the skeptics of climate change conveyed their ideologies. It was also interesting to see how climate change became a partisan issue over time due to companies buying politicians and the republican party. I was shocked that so many people did not believe in climate change because I come from a state where mostly everyone, I know believes in climate change. If there can ever be progress in the climate crisis, the two parties will have to come together to solve the issues. I don't believe that all these republican politicians actually do not believe in climate change, it is just the giant industries paying them to spew their lies. If we made it illegal for industries like fossil fuels to fund politicians I believe that there would be progress in Washington that we have never seen before. Ultimately, I became pessimistic to that subject matter because the idea that so many politicians can be bought and so many people can be tricked into becoming skeptics is insane and really shows the problem in our current political system.

In 2008, the country was poised to tackle climate change as a relatively bi-partisan issue. As we know now, it is far more than a bipartisan issue, now an issue involving all of man kind. Organizations like the American Tradition Institute mentioned in ‘A Climate of Doubt’ contributed to the presence of climate change deniers. They also often appear as human influenced climate change deniers, who vehemently insist the unprecedented phenomena are a result of the Earth’s own biology. This is simply not true. And this is a dangerous truth to perpetuate. I understand many people believe this science and have their own personal best interests at heart subscribing to this ideology. But ignorance is not a reasonable defense. The impending danger is too real and reasonable and devastating to be debated over. Realistically, anything at all that delays our reaction time is just contributing to the days on Earth we will lose.

It angers me that there are people out there who are unwilling to accept the fact that there is indeed a problem with the climate. There are so many politicians out there such as those in the film who are doing everything that they can to convince the general public that everything they are doing is completely fine and that there should be no worries towards the climate. Seeing this and knowing that they are in the pocket of big companies that are the ones creating this big effect should evidently point towards the fact that something should be done towards the corrupt nature of politics. To these people, they say that the climate crisis is a joke and should be treated as so. This is so unreasonable as there is substantial evidence that if we don’t do anything, the earth will slowly decline. There are many politicians who don’t know enough to even speak on this matter and yet they do. They do and people still fall for their trap. These politicians have no cares about what they whatsoever and are willing to say anything just to get everyone to believe that there is no problem. The fact that they are so under informed yet have enough power for others to just take their word for is disgusting. The ignorance present in these people is so prominent which should serve for us as a strong indicator that these people should not be trusted. We should do everything in our power to stop these politicians from slandering the name of the government and do something to save the earth.

Watching the film “Climate of Doubt,” I felt frustrated in seeing that there were that many people who put so much effort into stopping climate change. It also angers me that it has become such a political issue that further divides Democrats and Republicans. Climate change is not political or economic. It is urgent. The fact that there was a point where most of the government agreed that we need to take action shows that there is hope. We once had mostly everyone on the same page, yet the efforts form the fossil fuel companies put out false information and have now created less people joining the effort, and further dividing politics. As we saw last week, the climate emergencies such as hurricanes, fires, and melting ice caps do not care how rich or poor of a county you are or care what political party you are. Australia has burned, Paradise has burned, and hurricanes are affecting some of the most conservative states. It would be so much easier if companies such as ExxonMobil spend their money on helping climate change and switching over to renewable energy instead of trying to stop government efforts to decrease the usage of fossil fuels. It is inevitable that someday these fossil fuels will not be used anymore. It’s very scary how much power the fossil fuel industries have on the government and how easy it is for money to control the rest of the country. It also seemed that most of the people leading these efforts against climate change are old white men. It is very frustrating to me in seeing that people who will probably be dead in a few decades are going to have such a huge impact on the generations that come after them.

“Carbon dioxide is plant food! It is good for the environment!”. It is beyond insane to see what the opposing side has come up with in the supposedly scientific debate. Spreading misinformation while demanding scientific integrity from the scientists who support the theory of anthropogenic climate change is a hypocritical move. What is more interesting is that many people here in America (but not limited to America) do support these ridiculous claims. One main tactic that the climate deniers use is to associate climate control as a loss of freedom, a loss of rights, and exploiting the self-indulging nature of human beings. When the future of our species is threatened, we need everyone taking some minor steps, some minor “sacrifices” (those little actions cannot even be called sacrifices).
   <br><br>
 “The ocean will win.” It might be true. The Earth has already gone through five major extinction events, and it can just as easily wipe us out as before. “Climate has been changing all the time and we shouldn’t worry.” We are literally helping the Earth dig our own grave, of course it has been changing, but this anthropogenic influence is too great to be ignored, and we need to mitigate before it is too late.

I really do not understand the argument that addressing climate change will create a loss of rights and freedom. It reminds me of a video I watched a while ago of a libertarian rally protesting the use of drivers' licenses in the United States. One man even shouts, "What's next, we'll have to have a license for using our toasters at home?" This comment stuck out to me because of its sheer ignorance. Driving a car is literally driving a death machine that can kill you and the people around you instantly with one wrong move. Having a license proves some sort of competence in driving and helps keep the people around you safe. Protesting drivers' licenses is selfish and the only argument against it for those people is that they just don't like the government. Protesting the idea that climate change exists is even more selfish and dangerous because we are literally experiencing the consequences of climate change denial at this moment and the people in power in our country can be convinced with money and status.

The documentary “Climate of Doubt'' reveals how organizations and individuals that do not believe in climate change have managed to make this a political issue rather than an environmental issue. While I know that not everyone believes in climate change, I never have considered how climate crisis doubters try to convince the public that climate change is not real. Getting to see the tactics climate crisis deniers use to address the public was interesting and disturbing. I was surprised to see in the beginning of the film how there was a conference held about debunking climate change in the same city in which Obama was in. I never would have expected for organizations to try to spread their message by going as far as organizing climate conferences. It’s frightening to see how an act like this can misinform the public and give climate crisis deniers more power to continue their movement. It’s unfortunate knowing how easily the public can fall for their tactics if they are not well informed about this topic prior to hearing the disinformation presented.  
   <br><br>

Watching this documentary, I couldn’t help but feel anger and disappointment. It was hard to try to continue watching it in order to get an understanding of why this agenda is pushed. However, I think a “Climate of Doubt” gives a good insight about how politics work and demonstrates how many politicians do not have concerns about issues that will likely not impact them immediately. It upsets me to see how politicians would rather ignore and deny an issue as important as this and feel no remorse about it. For example, Myron Ebell’s “sorry” apology he makes to justify if he and other climate deniers are wrong to me is pathetic. It’s truly sad to see how individuals have a hard time believing facts simply because it goes against their beliefs.

Funny how things age just a little too well. This film is eight years old...allow that to simmer. I was a elementary school when this film came out. At a time where climate change was not an issue that I needed to worry about it is infuriating to see the consequences now because nothing has changed unfortunately and now I have to take on the responsibility of "fixing" the world. Apart from the little action the adults did then it's the corruption that is eating away at our planet. Greed, selfish greed-well more specifically money. Here I was thinking that climate change deniers were somewhat stupid or too hard headed to see through the lies but now I've come to realize how big corporations purposefully make the issue practically headache inducing. Since big fossil fuel companies can't actually back up statements with evidence then they resort to confusing almost cult like convincing statements to get people to question their proportionality. Essentially this is the goal like Ken was stating, inflicting doubt is the best way to slowly but effectively tear at a group or in this case a social movement. All for what? You know, I know, Ken knows- it's about the bread they make. These corporations are fully aware of the damages they've cause and continue to do but to them it's a lot more compelling to die in a house of gold.

Watching merchants of doubt was a perspective changing event for me. I was aware that many organizations and individuals related to oil companies behaved in questionable ways and made plans for post climate change drilling, but I was unaware just how much they behaved like cigarette companies had. The idea of the internal studies made by cigarette companies and oil companies who both realise their product is harmful makes sense, and I have little surprise for that. What surprised me was the amount of power big tobacco was able to take, with a product who the consumer was far less reliant on, and began to make me think about how much control big oil conglomerates must have over government and regulations. Similarly, the ability of corporations to make themselves seem removed from climate related debate while paying people to pretend to independently renounce climate change is terrifying and telling. The lack of direct association most large corporations have with talks on climate change is a demonstration of their wish to try to distance themselves from the situation to profit for as long as possible. I believe the line Fred Seitz stated, “it was irresponsible on the part of smokers,” when talking about how they believed the lies being fed to them by the tobacco companies, truly captured the capitalist higher ups views of society. The poor man is foolish for being poor, the sick man is foolish for being sick, and me myself not using my ability to help them by telling them in advance their mistakes would have these affects, is not at all wrong.
    <br><br>
The idea that individuals have seen environmentalism as socialism or communism is a ridiculous exaggeration of what would need to be done. These individuals love to preach about how they do not want government to overuse its power, until the excess of power benefits them. Take for instance Trumps government shutdown, costing thousands to be forced to leave their career just to pay the bills because one man in the white house would not approve spending unless money was given to the item ticket that he wanted. Republicans (the party with the most climate deniers) celebrated this shutdown as their president standing his ground, yet had a president pulled the same stunt to divert spending to a green new deal, or any other progressive idea, those same individuals would complain of jobs losses, government expenditures, back pay, and any other inconvenience they could find. 
   <br><br>
 In regards to the individuals whose argument is that the predictions of the effects of climate change haven’t all come true or have only partially come true, it is not a situation of black and white. A prediction which comes partially true, or comes true later than expected, or occurs in a different manner, can still be evidence. Many of the deniers either are poorly informed, wrongly informed or simply do not want to face the evidence or data. The information about the Oregon Petition was helpful information to use, as now if someone attempts to reference it, I can use the counterargument of it being disavowed for not containing the signatures of real scientists. I very much liked the statement “I like working in a bike shop, there is more thinking that goes on in a bike shop than the think tank.”

 It is extremely alarming that politicians have been so corrupted with greed, that the fact that our planet is dying does not strike a single brain cell in their heads. Like Ken mentioned in this video, a great battle is underway; a battle that will decide the future of every living being on this planet. If the side of fossil fuels wins, we are all doomed. They will receive a couple more years of tainted money and power, but that victory will be short-lived. On the other hand, if the people win, we can turn the trajectory of our destiny around. We can better our society and the condition of our planet.

During the film, the response Myron Ebell gave after being asked what would happen if the climate skeptics were wrong, will forever haunt me. His response to the lost lives of so many people and the utter destruction of an entire ecosystem would be "I would be sorry."

I don't understand what scientists who agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it can gain from doing so. What reason would they have to lie? To make up statistics? Are climate denialists just so set in their ways that they believe this massive amount of scientists agree solely out of spite and to incite chaos? On the flip side, it is SO transparent what denialists have to gain from denying the truth. Money. No regulations on extracting things with extreme monetary value. So. Much. Money. It is interesting that these denialists and their beliefs appeal to the working class population of America, who have nothing to gain from these rich people's greed.

The Climate of Doubt just made me pretty angry. How can something so obvious to me be so clouded to others? How can these people be so good at their jobs that they've managed to convince millions that a devastating issue is not currently occurring? It's almost as if they're choosing not to acknowledge the truth only because it would inconvenience them. And honestly, that's probably not even a "almost as", that's likely a very factual statement. It's disgusting. I can't understand how greed can be prioritized over billions of lives at stake.

After watching the movie, “Climate of Doubt” I am again just disappointed in America and its citizens. The people who are in positions of power to make changes simply choose not to out of ignorance. This speaks to not only our leaders but the people as well. It’s like we live in our own little bubble and as long as life is okay currently that’s all that matters. Christopher Monckton, speaking on behalf of the Science and Public Policy Institute, states, “Warming isn't, in fact, accelerating. There’s been none for 15 years…. The right response to the non-problem of global warming is to have the courage to do nothing.” And after reading that I was just dumbfounded. This man was speaking on behalf of an institute meant to inform the public and he was completely denouncing the single greatest issue the world is facing. And what makes it worse is that people just blindly listened. In just four years the number of Americans who believed in anthropogenic climate change dropped by ½ simply because they were persuaded by economic circumstances. We were on a path to do good as Obama became president because he backed a cap-and-trade approach intended to regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but as the 2008 recession hit, Americans again chose money over the environment. This crisis provided the perfect opportunity for climate deniers to gain traction as they could denounce the tax saying it would equate to higher taxes, fewer jobs, and less freedom. It’s sad because people were going through real tough times and were easily influenced into inaction. Looking at it in the big picture, our lack of care about climate change is a failure because as a country we are the most equipped to tackle the problem and we simply don’t care.

After watching "A Climate of Doubt", it was clear to me how much effort is put in to basically mask the truth about climate change. An issue that is proven to detrimentally affect literally everyone has now become just a conspiracy. It is astonishing to me the lengths that big businesses and fossil fuel investors will go through to keep making money at the expense of not only themselves but the entire world. It's hard for me to understand the point of trying to extract the rest of natural resources to make money when money inevitably won't matter when climate change leads to destruction of most of our earth. I found it interesting that it was noted how global warming has shifted from global emergency to simply a political issue. It’s mind boggling that we were so close to taking preventative action against global warming because of how alarmed we were but it quickly was taken over into politics. This documentary did so well exposing many thought-of “scientific” movements that were actually political campaigns. Global warming is so much more than just politics, we’re running on limited resources and time to act yet the general population is constantly persuaded that it's not a prominent issue or one that applies in every sector including economical and geographical. Science is what we rely on to exist and it is being bought out by predominantly old white men without scientific approval to be masked and manipulated at the expense of our lives.

It annoys me to see climate skeptics show no concern for the ecosystem. They are too caught up in the middle of the schemes politicians have put in our society that it would be a challenge to show them or emphasize to them what is true or false. Politics has been manipulated to the point where one is unsure of whether the news topic serves as a distraction from the truth, and vice versa. And it’s unfortunate how the world has become this way. As consumers of the media, absorbing what we learn from the news is no longer an ideal way to obtain a deeper and richer knowledge of the topics that matter to us. Overall, you can never be too sure of what you learn from highly respectable politicians, authors, researchers, and etc. until their motive is revealed to you.

"Merchants of Doubt" does its job of dramatically narrating what happens - the pushing of fire-retardant furniture by the tobacco industry was actually pretty enlightening, and it makes me wonder about where else this sort of thing might be happening - aside from, you know, climate change.

Wow. I didn’t think my Sunday spent doing homework could get more upsetting until I watched this video on a bunch of old white men endlessly rambling about an issue they have no scientific background in. One of the old white guys explained that he was fighting for scientific truth while describing climate change as a “phantom issue” that will not change no matter what we do. White guy #2 described carbon dioxide as plant food, after admitting he was not an expert on the subject. Fred Singer, the main old white guy in this video who is a powerful advocate for climate change skeptics also disagrees that second hand smoke can be harmful… am I missing something or were parts of  this video humorous to watch? 
   <br><br>
I appreciated the analogy made of having a sick kid to 97% of scientists agreeing that climate change is anthropogenic, hopefully this paints a better picture for those who don’t believe there is a consensus on this issue. A Climate of Doubt reminded me of a video of a man interviewing Tr*mp supporters at a rally. Throughout the interview, each person proudly wearing MAGA gear contradicted themselves and clearly had absolutely no. idea. what. they. were. talking. about. Watching it was simultaneously hilarious and depressing. The PBS documentary displayed an alarming amount of similarities to the interviews conducted at the Tr*mp rally. Sadly, I think only those who are already in support of efforts to reduce man made climate change can see how idiotic deniers look.

<p>
The movie Merchants of Doubt is about the danger of issues like smoking and global warming, and how a small fraction of people still try very hard to deny the danger. In the movie and also in the lectures, we learned that some of the scientists are with the big corporations and certain industries like fossil fuels. So for the profits, they will mislead the public and try to deny or dilute the problems that have already existed. 
   <br><br>

I feel like the environmental issues that we are facing now are very important to each one of us, because no one can live without a habitable environment. So it is necessary for people to think about the future and work as a group to solve the problems. People need to stop being selfish and only care about money or profits, protecting the Earth is much more important than the benefits they are earning. We need to face the problems, not denying them. People can ignore the issues and deny the evidence, but there will be a day when people are dying due to the bad environment, they will regret their actions. So we should start facing the problems and do something to improve them right now, there is no time for us to wait anymore.

<p>
After watching Merchants of Doubt I feel like I have a better understanding of how the fossil fuel industry has managed to blind people to the truth even though all the facts are right before our eyes. 
   <br><br>
It’s unbelievable to me how many parallels there is between climate change and the tobacco scandal, yet people still don’t see they are being fooled. Speaking out against the dangers tobacco/cigarettes was seen as “making political statements not scientific statements,” which is what today, some argue is what climate change is about. One part I especially liked about the film is when the TV host says he isn’t hurting anyone by smoking and Stan Glantz says “that’s bullshit,” which the audience is outraged by. Today that’s mirrored by the fact that some refuse to accept that burning fossil fuels is detrimental to the environment. The public relations firm hired by the tobacco industry explained “doubt is our product,” which makes perfect sense because it’s easy to make people believe “we need more evidence . . . there is no consensus,” and once doubt is planted it's easier to influence individuals’ decisions.
   <br><br>
The extent the tobacco industry went to protect their product is ridiculous, but it’s more ridiculous that people bought the lies. When cigarettes began causing fires in homes, cigarettes were not to blame. Instead, Peter Sparber was hired, and managed to convince people the true problem was the furniture (HUH??), so flame retardants were put in couches. Sparber also worked for the pesticide and oil industries. 
   <br><br>
What really made me see things from a new perspective was to “swing the question over to the freedom of choice issue.” A big argument about climate change is that “environmental regulation is a slippery slope to communism,” and I think by appealing to people’s “anti-communism” side, big industries use “freedom” to mask their corporate interests. It’s more than “smoking cigarettes,” it’s “having the freedom to smoke because you chose to,” and similarly it’s not “supporting the fossil fuel industry,” it’s “pumping gas to have the freedom to go where you choose.” Because of mentality like this, David Koch was introduced as “just a tireless defender of our economic and individual freedoms,” meanwhile Koch Industries heavily invest in coal, oil, and tar sands, and are the biggest polluters in the country.

This film is very interesting looking at it from the perspective of someone that knows that climate change is a real thing and was brought upon by human nature. To pay people to come to talk about how they are trying to debunk the climate crisis and find every which way to try to put the change in climate on anything and anyone but our own actions are unbelievable. 
   <br><br>

People need to be less gullible and realize that the only people that are trying to persuade you that climate change isn't real are the people that have something to benefit if you end up believing that climate change isn't real. The fossil fuel companies are threatened right now because everyone is finally realizing what we have been doing to ourselves and our environment and fossil fuels are on the outs. This is why they are doing so much advocating and paying people to tell you that climate change is not a real thing. the more people that believe that the more money the fossil fuel companies will maintain.

Something I noticed in “Climate of doubt” is that there are a lot of older scientist refusing to accept studies done by other climatologist that don’t match their beliefs. I pointed out that they’re older because it’s quite possible that they are refusing to accept climate change because what they learned back then, does not match the science today. There is also a constant reference to “the consensus,” but doesn’t this just mean that the politicians and “climatologist” are following group think? It doesn’t sound like they have done their homework and actually researched the issue (especially the politician in the assembly who says co2 is plant food, sounds like he just knows the science he learned in grade school.) This should very concern because people who have no understanding or reputability, are the leaders in this climate change argument. Imagine a lawyer who is trying to give surgical advice. That makes no sense to me and I’m quite surprised people listen to these kinds of advocates. When they interviewed the politician Fred Singer, he sounds kind of like a robot or reading from a script. To me at least, its obvious that he’s someone who isn’t qualified to speak on this topic, especially when he acknowledges that other scientist whom he supports, are not qualified. How is someone like this so influential?

A Climate of a Doubt is a very frustrating film to watch. it shows the roles politics plays in the climate crisis. It shows how no matter how much scientific evidence is shown, it can be brushed off as "malpractice" and all the evidence is just gone. Politicians come off as some of the worst people to help save the environment. They will completely ignore what the popular opinion is and the evidence that comes along with it just to pass bills that benefit them. Also, they use their opinions or facts that aren't true to try and further their argument on how the Earth is fine when it is not. One quote that bugged me was "There's nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It'll get colder. It'll get warmer. We just have to wait a little."  Fred Singer claims he is fighting for the scientific truth but says this? He wants to believe whatever he thinks is correct instead of looking at the evidence that presented to him and all the other politicians as well.

Like in many other facets of life, this documentary “Climate of Doubt”, demonstrates how the problem of climate change has been heavily dependent and involved with politics. It is a bit ironic how the majority of people who don’t believe in climate change are under the impression that those who support and promote notions of climate change are being bribed, consequently, making climate deniers believe it to be false. It’s almost laughable how blatant the real enemy is. The oil and fossil fuel industries. For years they have pumped cashflow into promoting anti-climate change notions in order to keep the longevity of their businesses at a high. It is human greed at the core. However, what they fail to realize, or maybe just don’t care and have been so consumed by greed, is that if they continue to promote this rhetoric, the world will be so messed up all the money in the world won’t be able to fix it and then they cannot enjoy the copious amount of money they have. Refuters take data such as a 10 year period in order to use as evidence for their claim that temperatures are cooling when, in fact, the opposite is true when you look over decades of data that show the overall temperature is increasing.

<p>
Just recently, I had an insightful conversation about the American system with a couple of my peers. We talked about the corruption that comes with a capitalistic society. Greed is a powerful factor in disrupting morals. In the end, we agreed that government intervention is a must in order to keep human rights in check. Human nature is just bred to hoard resources, and if let free in the market, it will destroy humanity. However, I saw a darker side to this reality; the fuel companies already have so much influence on the world that they'd do anything to keep their position. They already hold so much wealth, and with money, it turns into power.

   <br><br>

The documentary added on to my beliefs as it explores how climate change became a political issue dues to these exact companies. It amazes me how strong skepticism can be to affect the world.



</p><hr>


<p>
While watching this film I was incredibly frustrated for multiple reasons. The first was that the  whole world was warned early on and there was even momentum to make a change for the better but some corporate greed and some unfortunate things happened such as climate gates that deterred a lot of people. The second was that even though we know even more today so many people still deny it. In order to fight climate change a large amount of money would be lost in large corporations that rely on carbon emission based products so they tend to prey on the weak minds of those easily convinced. I learned from the film that the same tactics that tobacco companies used to sell their product was used on the denial of climate change , and people bought it. There are thousands of scientists that say it's real and there is LITERAL evidence but some people just believe “Whatever science made good sense.” Its astounding how dumb some people are. These denials ``play games with the data '' in order to prove their point. A clear cherry picking that actually works on some people. This film just made me hate the older generations more and more. Not only are they unwilling to educate themselves on the truth but they go out of their way to find whatever “data” supports their bullshit agenda. I have  had it with them and will definitely be voting for a better tomorrow.

The film, “Climate of Doubt,” portrays how the climate crisis has become a political issue, and how politicians view the issue. Within the first couple of minutes, I was already surprised to learn that climate change deniers had an entire conference that advertised climate change as a “hoax”. Of course I knew that there were deniers out there, but I did not know that they were so serious. I think I am just shocked to see how many people do not believe in climate change and think that it is not an issue to be concerned about. 
   <br><br>
Later in the film, Coral Davenport, states that she wanted to ask all of the Republican members of Congress three questions about climate change, and none of them wanted to respond. I honestly was not surprised to hear that those particular politicians were avoiding these questions - seems like that is what they are best at doing. I have never felt more annoyed while watching a film. It is concerning to see how some politicians feel towards an issue that is leaving its physical mark/consequence on the Earth, yet they are still convinced that it is not real.



</p><hr>


<p>
The climate change debate between climate alarmists and deniers is very complicated, and it was hard to understand at first, but after watching this Frontline documentary Climate of Doubt, I now understand how the climate crisis became such an economic and political issue. It is crazy to learn about the history of this conflict, how American politicians used to be convinced and openly speak about global warming being an issue of national security until the 2012 election. Lobbyists and advocacy groups supporting the “free market” and less government regulation began to garner popularity and influence, using Cap and Trade as a means to propagate the idea of “lost jobs, higher taxes, and less freedom.” It is almost unbelievable how this debate has played out. Anonymous funding groups, like DonorsTrust, should be illegal. People should request information from DonorsTrust and advocacy groups like the Heartland Institute and Americans for Prosperity using the Freedom of Information Act. 
   <br><br>

I end my comment with these words from the documentary by Andrew Dessler. He said, “I want to make sure that in 50 years or 100 years or 200 years, nobody can ever say we didn’t warn them.” Advocacy groups, fossil fuel companies, and climate deniers only care about the now and how to keep their money, whereas climate scientists think about the future. We are already seeing the effects of climate change now with the California, Amazon forest and Australian wildfires, and simple apologies from people like Myron Ebell isn’t good enough.



</p><hr>


<p>
As mentioned by Senator John Kerry, "there was an uneasy consensus" on climate change before a plan of actions was proposed to do something about it. It is a reminder that the issue is not really about whether or not climate change is "real" but whether or not we do something about it. There are those who are concerned about future generations of the human race, and there are those concerned with keeping things the way they are, because this is a situation from which they benefit. To some people, money and power in the present means more than the possibility of it in the future. Unfortunately, they put this money and power to use in convincing unsuspecting people that their interests are aligned - when in fact that couldn't be further from the truth.

<p>
While watching, "A Climate of Doubt", the main thing that stood out to me is that every politician was at least 40 years old or more. In order to make a difference, we need younger people to be there passing bills and making new laws. People who have been educated on the climate crisis and want to make a difference because it will affect their lives. To me, these politicians seem selfish. When people that are such large influences on Americans start to deny climate change, they start to brainwash everyone who follows them. Also, a lot of these people are not even credible to be able to form those kind of statements. Even Christopher Monckton has admitted to having no sort of scientific qualifications but was shouting that "global warming is bulls**t". It upsets me that these politicians are more concerned about money than saving our planet.


</p><hr>


<p>
After watching “Climate of Doubt,” I am upset about our situation. Climate change is already a serious problem, which is threatening our world, but politicians and some organizations still keep the public blind, because they do not want to take responsibilities. All they focus on is their profit, which is selfish. It is undeniable that people should be directly responsible for climate crisis, but some people just want to avoid it. Bureaucracy is disgusting because some politicians only do what is best for themselves while they claiming that they care about their people. Greenhouse emission, sea level rising, animals’ migration, there are so many signs alarming us of climate change, we just keep denying it. And what makes me really mad about is that some people in power do not even take it seriously. “There’s nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do.” How ridiculous and stupid the words are. Nature will not help us until we treat it better. We finally have to pay for our debt.




</p><hr>


<p>
Before watching the Climate of Doubt, I thought the people who are opposing climate change are those with a worse education or those who are negligent of this problem. But this movie made me realize that I was very incorrect. People who oppose the existence of climate change are actually the ones in power, and it is by their will the majority of the population is misinformed.  Hard to accept the fact that they are doing it just to receive more money from the companies they are defending by denying the problem. 
   <br><br>

So many scientists agree that climate change is happening: they present all the facts, provide solutions, but this very valuable information remains unnoticed. This means that their opinion is apparently not enough for a lot of people since they prefer their own wealth and "happiness" over the lives of innocent others. Therefore, the only option that I can see is voting for those candidates who will bring changes to the government and help us save the planet. There simply seems to be no other choice, and it is terrifying. 
   <br><br>


I think everyone should watch this movie just to realize the number of lies we are being told by so many people in power. It is really sad to see how little people care and how little we can do from our position to change their minds and demand change.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the film, “Climate of Doubt”, I was surprised at how convincing their arguments can be. Before this, I always wondered how people could actually deny climate change was happening since there are so many red flags around us. In the video, people were saying how there are more pressing topics to worry about, especially when it comes to passing legislation and while I agree that these are important issues to worry about, the climate changing will affect everyone and now there is not much time left to do something about it. If we keep putting it off, soon it will be too late and there won’t be much to fix anymore but it won’t be until then that people will open their eyes and want to act.



</p><hr>


<p>
The film Merchants of Doubt made me realize that it's not the science that people don’t believe, but the fact that they don’t want to change the way they live. Big oil companies pay people to spin the truth and deny that climate change is happening. The people who don’t want to change grasp at the fact and make themselves feel better about the fact that they aren’t doing anything to help. Moreover, these truth spinners started latching to these climate regulations as an attack on freedom and that’s the one thing that always gets Americans to act.
    <br><br>

I just find it insane that big oil companies are getting away by misleading the American people. But what’s more insane is that they got this playbook from the tobacco industry. The way those people blatantly lied and said smoking was not harmful knowing all the damage it actually was doing is criminal. But what makes this even worse is that they used fire retardants as scapegoats which led to even more chemicals being put inside American bodies. These companies clearly have no regard for the health or freedoms of Americans, they just want money.
    <br><br>

Furthermore, the way Marc Morano gleefully misguides people is disgusting. He was proud to send these emails to the IPCC authors and clearly did not care for their safety when allowing these death threats to be sent by purposely posting their emails. Some people just want to fight for what’s right and it’s people like Marc who make it difficult. One optimistic thing that I saw in this movie is that the more bullshit that is being spewed, means that big oil companies are scared that we are closer to getting climate regulation.



</p><hr>


<p>
As many of the articles and documentaries that we watch and read in this class, “Climate of Doubt” made me nothing but angry. I’ve long hated the political speech and disruption that make it so hard to pass things that will help Americans as a whole. It reminds me of filibustering in the US congress. 
    <br><br>

This anti-climate change group is a group run by spread of disinformation and money from big corporations. They have amassed a group of mostly conservative supporters. And to be honest, watching this film made me more empathetic towards the supporters of the anti-climate change movement because a lot of their message is so damn believable. And by having a different perspective or not looking at the data close enough, I could definitely have followed their message. I noticed them using terminology that I had heard before from other smaller groups used to sway people to their side. For instance one promoter said “Now we are met on a great battlefield of a new civil war” and they call it a story of david and goliath against big government. Many if not all of us are victim to blindly stating our opinion on something without deeply reading into the evidence about it. This type of terminology is attracted anti-government groups of people(mostly conservatives) to their side that don’t deeply investigate the topic. 
    <br><br>

This is why this technique of disinformation is so successful to their cause and harmful to the climate change movement.


</p><hr>


<p>
The film, A Climate of Doubt, is created to display how climate skeptics prove what they called the “truth” about climate change. In order to do that, what they do is only to attack only some of the evidence provided by climate activists. Among all the data they provide, there is only fallacy. For example, they are using the blindness of common knowledge to defend their points. I understood why politicians are not giving clear opinions on how they are thinking about this issue. But I think this is being more and more urgent in this age as climate change is not only posing threats to civic lives, but also to national economy. I know, that the implementations of regulations are also going to affect the society as a whole by the number of job loss. Former president Obama was not saying anything; Romney was not saying anything. However, the effect is definitely going to be smaller than suffering what climate change brings to us. In addition, look at what China is doing right now. China is actually using this opportunity of overcoming climate change to develop technology on renewable energy use.

<p>
In the 2012 PBS film, “A Climate of Doubt”, a wide range of beliefs on the topic of climate change were portrayed.  I thought it was interesting how, when asked about their beliefs in spite of certain undeniable statistics, many of the non-believers of anthropogenic climate change were truly unfazed.  In the area I grew up in most people believed in anthropogenic climate change, so it was very useful to see the other side of the argument.  I understand the problems that many people have with the carbon cap/tax, mostly because it would create a bigger divide between the poor and the rich (the rich who can afford to find sustainable alternatives versus the middle to poor class americans who rely on the affordability of carbon), but some of their reasoning behind advocating against climate change is unnecessary in my view.  Some said that the reason why they are fighting against the idea that the climate is affected anthropogenically is for people to focus on the greater issues of the world at hand, but why aren’t they doing that?
     <br><br>
Something that was also very fascinating to me was how Exxon was funding many of the organizations that were opposing the idea that a huge carbon influx in the atmosphere could impact our Earth.  It did not surprise me at all, but mostly just reminded me of how difficult it is when corporations, who have their own agenda in mind, use their money as power.  No matter what the right answer is, their input skewed for their own benefit will forever leave the question open.

“Merchants of Doubt” was an extremely frustrating film to watch as it dives into the manipulative behaviors and tactics major companies and climate change deniers use to push their agendas. It was eye-opening to see the connections between the tobacco and the fossil fuel industry; how tobacco companies paid people to “cast a shadow of doubt” over the clear data that was in front of everyone, just like fossil fuel companies, today, trying to do the same thing with climate data. Oreskes notes that the tobacco companies eventually received the punishments they deserved after 50 years, and we simply don’t have that time when it comes to the climate crisis. So it is so frustrating to watch us get close to change such as when Obama went to Copenhagen’s climate change conference and while he was there the “Climategate” scandal broke and the whole conference was muddled with the idea that climate change might not be real. Another example of this was the Oregon petition, the fact that among the “scientists” who signed the petition were the spice girls and Charles Darwin, makes a joke of the climate crisis and shows that climate change deniers don’t see this as a problem they need to fix. To see time and time again when change is about to occur and then coincidentally things are published or released to make people doubt even if just for a little and slow the progress we so desperately need is infuriating. I couldn’t even imagine dedicating my life to science and having someone like Marc Morano release my email to receive death threats and for him to laugh at it and say it’s one of the best parts of his job, absolutely disgusting. After watching this movie, I couldn’t help but feel hopeless. I believe that one day everyone will realize climate change is very much real but it will be too late and the damage will be too much to recover from, but only time will tell.

What are politics? The simple answer is the struggle for power. When does the human desire for power diminish? Never. People want. They want and they want and they want some more. Power. Money. Attention. Any topic has supporters as well as opposers. When we are talking about climate change, there will always be people who are not convinced. 
     <br><br>


Right off the bat, the left was known for believing in it and the right was known for denying it. Right away the issue of climate change was a political one. Not a matter of science. It begs the question of why and how that came to be. I’m happy that Ken decided to have us watch a film that focuses on the perspective of climate deniers and how they perceive the entire issue. When looking at this huge topic, we need to understand why and how people believe that climate change does not exist, so eventually, I think all students could have guessed that we were going to watch something addressing the nay-sayers. The other part of the film that really stuck with me was the analogy given about the doctors’ advice. If you had a sick child, would you listen to what 97% of doctors recommended you to do or choose something completely different? That really stuck with me and will continue to do so when I have this conversation with others.



</p><hr>


<p>
When watching “A Climate of Doubt”, it was so fascinating to hear what sort of rhetoric a climate denier has when asked about the environment. I thought that this movie was so different than anything we have seen before, as it brought a different and much more real perspective of the use of politics in the conversation of climate change. 
     <br><br>

Before watching “A Climate of Doubt”, I had little to no clue as to why and how a climate denier would play off one of the biggest threats to mankind ever. As the film showed main climate denier arguments, these individuals are motivated by nothing but one thing; money. It was so fascinating to me the complex steps multi-million dollar companies take to promote illusions among the American people. I was utterly shocked to learn about the manipulative grasp tobacco companies have onto the public, to cover up their tracks and making sure that their profits are not hindered. As to not hinder their brand name, it was shocking to hear about how these companies will pay anyone (firefighters, doctors, etc.) to manipulate their profits. 
     <br><br>

It was so interesting to see how far people will go through to protect their brand and make a profit, but while watching the film I always had one question in mind; “How can these people do this?” This earth is the only place we get to call home, so as a human kind why are we so fond of destroying it for nothing?

I had the same reaction after watching 'A Climate of Doubt". The idea that groups of people get together at an annual conference every year, known as the annual pilgrimage for key skeptics, to prove that man-made global climate change is a myth is not only infuriating, but also bizarre. Why do groups such as the Heartland Institute push their misinformed agenda so strongly to the point of having yearly conferences, and referring to themselves as "rebels against science and media"? It seems as if they're overcompensating their declining support by having these rallies in efforts to continue to convince people of their dangerous ideologies. As I watched part of the conference take place, it showed different speakers going up onto the stage, bringing the audience to their feet each time. It seems to me sort of cultish and feel strange about the whole thing. The film continued to go back and forth between advancements in climate change in politics and setbacks. Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" won him a Nobel Peace Prize and made the problem of climate change in the forefront of politics, but even in recent years the talk about working to fix the problem has become less and less. Rallies such as the ones portrayed in the movie continue to be harmful since they miseducate the public, and use concepts such as "American freedom" to convince people to doubt what's really happening. Myron Ebell himself said he opposed government action on climate change to defend American freedom. The irony in this is that by lack of doing anything and creating legislature to help the issue, American freedom is being limited inevitably.

Something I found both surprising and alarming in "Climate of Doubt" was the contrast between what politicians said in 2008 compared to both 2012 when the documentary took place and compared to now (2020). From the time I can remember following politics (I was born in late 2001), I knew that climate change denial was very prevalent in this country, usually with conservatives. I have always known it to be a partisan issue, and I was taken aback by how in 2008 every politician agreed that climate change was an important issue that needs to be addressed. Seeing Newt Gingrich alongside Nancy Pelosi announce that climate change is serious was shocking because I know that no Republican politician now would dare make such a video. It saddened me to see the machinations of the fossil fuel industry behind this drastic change in the stance Republican politicians take on climate change. I could not believe how many Republicans simply refused to answer a reporter's basic question on their stance on an important issue because they feared that answering it would cost them reelection.

     <br><br>

I am also in disbelief at how people can be motivated to spread climate change denial. While despicable, I do understand that those in the fossil fuel industry such as the Koch brothers would be willing to fund a disinformation campaign because they will directly profit. However, I do not understand how scientists like Fred Singer, or private citizens in charge of conservative institutes, can support this widespread denial of the facts. It shocks and saddens me that so many of the problems surrounding climate change actions stem directly from the actions of a few wealthy individuals willing to fund this deception.

<p>
In "A Climate of Doubt," my previously expressed ideas on the politics and widespread denial of climate change were confirmed. Fred Singer is the primary source of contrast towards the reality of climate change in this video. This is a prime example of someone who denies everything climate change related with no evidence to prove the contrary. With several peer-reviewed experiments shown his way, he keeps on denying them in this video, which seriously angers me. This really shouldn't be a debate anymore, however it is the large oil companies and climate change skeptics that will continue to kill the planet. I became increasingly frustrated while watching this not only because of the obvious political and social gains that these leaders were working towards, but also the emptiness of their argument. They constantly say there was "no evidence" that shows this is a man-made issue, and that's it. On the other side, there were several examples of scientific observations showing the obvious increase in global temperature. The climate skeptics are seriously deluded, and they will continue to give the future generations wrong information just to advance their political interests, and that seriously makes me angry.

It's pretty insane how although even 97% of scientists have been able to prove and support the drastic issue of climate change and it's harmful effects on the planet, that there are so many people who question the validity of not only their research, but the actual existence of climate change. People are so gullible, and are able to lead on by these politicians by simply just hearing a few words and a few statistics, and it's truly disheartening, how ignorant and blinded people can be. Not only are the citizens of this country so blatantly ignorant, but it's also pretty disgusting how these politicians are willing to sell themselves to these massive Oil Corporations for a couple of extra dollars, in exchange for the heath of our planet. I like how th edocumentary emphasizes that this notion of climate change is a big political issue, over an actual environmental issue, and its a very interesting view, because it's definitely not wrong. So many filthy politicians skew these devastating issues, slyly lying to the people, giving them hope, only to crush it all... all for a couple of extra votes. 
     <br><br>
One of the most disdainful moments of the documentary was when Myron Ebell's response to the question of the possibility of incorrect climate skeptics was simply "I would be sorry". It's just so hard to believe how selfish and heartless one can be, realizing that thousands and even millions of people are affected everyday due to your decisions and your words, yet you sit here and sitting like a damn sellout. Millions of people rely on many habitual ecosystems, and millions of species are slowly dying out all because of your mistakes and denial towards climate change. This issue and the corruption in politics really demotivates oneself, because it really comes down to the fact, that no matter how much you want change , there will always be something more. Terrible.

Climate crisis is constantly seen as something that needs to be “debunked” as many refuse to believe it exists. Politicians specifically would rather ramble about nonsense to confuse people rather than to look at the scientific facts. I think people need to understand that many things to produce harm to the world are the ones that try to steer people off from believing in climate crisis, and the reason for this is because they make money off people polluting the world with their products. In a way they succeed this this because they are able to mass produce in different ways than an eco-friendly product would since it requires more effort and would in turn cost more for the public. The economic aspect of things affects the way people shop and the produces they get that end up causing pollution.
     <br><br>

With politicians specifically, those who choose to not believe in the climate crisis make money off people who become skeptical of the situation. As mentioned, they want to confuse the public, and if they succeed, they more recognition they will get. In a way, I have been led to believe that politicians want to make outrages efforts to change people’s minds in order to get name recognition for being barbaric.

After watching the film, “A Climate of Doubt,” I feel the problem that we are facing is not only a climate problem but also a political problem.  Just like everyone knows the danger of tobacco but none of the countries ban tobacco-- because it provides huge economic benefits. Nowadays, fossil energy is still the main energy we use. If a country hastily reduced the use of fossil fuels, it will have a great impact on the local economy. That is why I think well-developed countries should lead the whole world to change this situation.

The film, A Climate of Doubt  does a good job at explaining the ties between politics and climate change along with the effects each had on one another. I found interesting the fact that 
     <br><br>
the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill that was meant to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases did not last long. Yet it makes sense that the people were fine with the bill until the economy was declining so they chose to blame the bill in being part of the reason of the problem. People blamed the bill for eliminating jobs and higher taxes which resulted in people denying that the climate crisis existed simply for their momentary convenience. I think it's not too much that people did not believe in climate change they just saw this idea of climate change meant more taxes and less job in their eyes so they automatically disliked the idea.It is amusing that skeptics continuously deny the climate crisis despite all the evidence and the trends showing cooling periods going up gradually. It is upsetting to know that skeptics are influencing the audience that is unaware and trying to make them more ignorant on what is occuring enabling them to take the climate crisis seriously.  At the end of the day, although there are several consensus backing up the climate crisis ultimately it is up to an individual if they choose to believe the clear information presented or completely deny it.

The documentary "Suspicious Merchant" tells us the story of the other side of the climate change debate and whether the story was artificial. It also shows the extent of human selfishness and the consequences of greed for others. It shows the extent to which a society can be manipulated, which is a frustrating reminder of the degree of public control over the rich and powerful. These fake news keep getting people's attention, while real scientists are ignored or even criticized, many of whom are killed by extortion for extorting the truth and showing us their evidence. Because this evidence will harm someone's interests.Obviously, people don't like being taxed and want to keep their jobs, which makes them call science a scam so that they can keep their money. We see the same problem over and over again: human beings prefer to live instead of sustainable living. Professor Hiltner even pointed out that these people "are fighting for their financial needs, not for the needs of the planet." In this case, individuals do not want to sacrifice their taxes to save future generations.

Upon viewing, I thought that A Climate of Doubt was extremely effective at communicating its point, stating that climate change was a major point of conversation a short while ago, but now has begun to cool down and not receive as much attention anymore. Having John Hockenberry travel across the country to collect multiple one on one interviews with people struggling with the events occurring due to climate change was an exquisite way to communicate their message in my opinion, as it allowed the casual viewer to feel the pain and suffering that people are currently going through with climate change and how we could end up in the exact same position if we don’t act fast. Additionally, the decision to not include a lot of scientific jargon paid off well for the directors, as it enables the viewer to further understand in depth and simplicity what is occurring to their planet. The film led me to feel pessimistic and uncomfortable. I constantly attempt to find ways to cut down on things like carbon gas emission by not driving as much or attempting not to eat red meat, but after viewing this film, I now realize my lousy attempts at cutting down C02 emissions are not even close to what I’ll have to begin doing to do my part.

As I watched “Climate of Doubt”, I was intrigued by the tactics employed by the fossil fuel interests and just how well they seemed to work. They spent large amounts of money to advertise to the people the falsehoods of climate science through methods such as paying off politicians and influential authorities to reject climate change, and then the deniers voted senators such as Inglis out of office for accepting climate change in a primarily-Red state, causing any other politicians to either shift their positions or remain quiet about their views in order to stay in office. Their tactics to sow dissent among the people of America has worked so well that it is rather scary. What is the most frightening about this documentary is that the events depicted in it helped shape the current political situation in regards to environmental regulations, meaning the dismantling of them by our incumbent president. This is only further delaying any proper action being taken by the US towards solving the crisis. While it is always still possible for things to change, as is, we are eagerly digging a greater hole than the one we are currently in due to fossil fuel interests, and that is frightening.

"A Climate of Doubt" was a frustrating film to watch. It pissed me off learning that Bob Ingils, who demonstrated dedication to the well being of constituents was not reelected. He went against the 'popular' consensus within his party and suffered for it. This just went to show how much money and therefore influence fossil fuel companies and affiliates really have. It makes me wonder whether people like Myron Ebell truly believe their public stance on climate change or they are simply following what is in their best financial interest. If it is the latter I can honestly understand their position a bit more, but it does not make it right and laws surrounding the current state of lobbying need revision. If it is the former, we (as a society) need to work on educating ourselves and not falling victim to biased information in order to limit the number of Myron Ebells in the world.

People have spent a lot of time deciding and changing. However, if they start to doubt the cause they are supposed to support, they are actually much less likely to change. There are many similarities between the tobacco industry and the fossil fuel industry. Unfortunately, as a result of both, innocent people have to pay the price for their greed. The film clearly shows how money controls people. The rich have chosen to deny their impact on the planet and help others reach a consensus that everyone makes money at the expense of the planet. It describes how people turn a blind eye to the damage caused. I found that people must justify the damage they caused. For the purpose of personal currency growth alone, this will cause suffering for generations.

“Climate of Doubt” is definitely one of the more political films we’ve been assigned. On a more conservative note, many white men were featured in this film regarding the rise in taxes or the presidential election with barack. They’re discussing the wrong issues. There are effective changes we can make to help the economy and the climate all in one. The film brought up the 2008 recession and environmental regulations, the impact wouldn’t have been that great but require companies to update their systems. Updating their systems can make a huge difference as seen in the film “Fire in Paradise”. Back to the political viewpoints, you can see how many people shift to the stereotypical viewpoint of their affiliated party. Breaking out against the stereotypes encourages people to consider the opposite viewpoint than what they’re “supposed” to think.
     <br><br>
In class, someone had mentioned that the environment is not a political issue. It’s not a lean left or lean right issue, but a green issue.

I completely agree. I found this film more difficult to follow as it was more political. It was also very annoying to see how these figures acted among each other, as you brought how they would follow their party even if they did not fully agree. Like you said if they broke out of these stereotypes it will encourage others to do the same. It is the fear of letting those you associate yourself with down that make you change your way of thinking. It is also the pressure of society, these leaders do not want to be seen as weak by the opponent party therefore they do not speak on their own beliefs about the topic. Yeah the issue has become a political because it affects politicians and their wealth. They realized that this environmental issue would affect them therefore they got involved in order to try and control it. In the end it is all about power.

After watching the film "Merchants of Doubt”, I really cannot believe that tobacco companies can even ignore people’s health and merely pursue their own benefits by seducing the customers and getting them addicted to the cigarettes so as to secure their sales. The harmful effects of smoking are always concealed from the public especially in the advertisements, where pretty much misleading information is sent. However, the situation of the climate crisis is just like what happens to the cigarettes and smokers. The politicians are merchants trying to hide the truth of climate change so as to earn more profits and make the final day as late as possible. Some scientists also may not reveal the facts and results well to people as well, which even worsen the current situation.

After watching "Climate of doubt", I was so overwhelmed about the extent of governors involving in climate crisis. Fossil fuel factories are trying to get everything they can from the usage of fossil fuels. Politicians are using their political power to control the discussion of climate change among the country. These facts are the sorrows of our century. The more people who are devoting themselves into industries that harm the environment, the more sever climate change situation will be.
     <br><br>
I always hold the belief that politics should be a thing to widen people's comprehensions of the problems we are facing as human beings. Sadly, nowadays politics is involved with so many economic profits and political powers that it is no longer clear. Nowadays there are a lot of politicians who deny the fact of climate change. They criticize the validity of the scientific researches. They debate to convince people there isn't climate change at all. They shall really be ashamed of what information they are trying to popularize to the crowd. 
     <br><br>
A country can only build up strong recognition and effective solutions towards climate change when the influential power of the society--such as political groups and big facilities, are taking climate change seriously and admit its existence. The overall structure of the political society should raise a point that our planet is not their tool for generating revenues. It's never justice or fair that human beings are making money from the sacrifice of our beautiful planet. Human beings and our planet should always be put on the same scale. We possess same extents of importance and value. No one should gain control over another one. I feel like the whole society should recognize the true value of the environment, that's the only way we build respect to how many things the environment had provided to us and shame of how many injuries we paid back.

A Climate of Doubt was a very moving film for me. More than anything I believe I was frustrated
by the way politicians seemed to remain unmoved by clear and factual science, science that
97% of scientists agree with. I think it was put best by the politician who moved to consider
climate change and was not reelected, who said that if you had a sick kid, and 97% of doctors
told you to go ahead with treatment, while 3% said don't do anything, the politicians would all do
nothing. I think it goes to prove that lobbying has a great deal more influence than the public
would believe. Politicians seem to be greatly more concerned with their own reelection,
agendas, and paycheck than the welfare of the world and the people. I think that more people
need to pay attention and watch this film, so we can be rid of ignorance to real issues and finally
move politicians and the public to act.

After viewing "Climate of Doubt" and Ken's video introducing the Frontline episode, I was left speechless and disheartened about the future of the planet after learning that organizations and people still refuse to believe in the climate crisis for their own greedy purposes. I found it particularly appalling that some American politicians don't believe in climate change and protect the fossil fuel industry to finance themselves, while having the audacity to accuse their democrat counterparts that they're trying enforce an extreme leftist agenda. Rather than take into consideration the well-being of the planet and the people of their country, corrupt conservative politicians completely disregard the safety of their constituents for the fossil fuel corporations that fatten their bank account. Their refusal to acknowledge the severity of the situation put at risk, not only American citizens, but the millions of poor people who will be significantly impacted by the results of climate change.

I found it so frustrating to watch this week’s film, “Climate of Doubt,” especially when American “scientist” Myron Ebell responded to the question of what if climate crisis deniers were to be proven wrong with, “I would be sorry,”  I couldn’t believe the blatant disregard for the future of billions.  Watching this film gave me insight into the political landscape of the climate crisis.  How an environmental issue could so easily be turned into a political hot topic.  One thing that stood out to me as exceedingly disturbing is the reality that the policies and administrative actions regarding global climate change will be decided by individuals who will not feel the major effects of the climate crisis firsthand, nor understand the complete danger that faces us in the future.

In the documentary Climate of Doubt, the viewers get an inside look into the conflict occurring in congress and the overall political system in relation to views on climate change. There has been a movement in these groups that believe that climate change is a hoax, and now more than in years before this trend has been gaining momentum. After watching this film, I was genuinely scared for the current state of our country. In so many of the video clips referring to those who believed climate change is false and that scientists are overestimating the current progression of it, the people who lead these movements were older white men. As a progressive women in our current age, I have always viewed climate change as a very real threat and to see so many people try to discredit this idea so that politics favors businesses over the wellbeing of the Earth is very disheartening. Science is correct and multiple climate and non-climate organizations have confirmed that we have very limited time to make positive actions to the Earth. In fact, so many of the effects of climate change are irreversible, making our actions to combat this more essential now than ever. I found it very hard to believe that there are so many organizations that try to discredit the science behind climate change, but once analyzing my own conversations with people I began to see it. So many people I have talked to about changing small actions in everyday life said that it would hold no real significance because they are one person in the grand scheme of the entire world. This idea is so incredibly damaging to the Earth because one person has a large ecological footprint on the world, according to our class lectures on climate change. I wish that people would watch this documentary so that they can see how idiotic those who are claiming climate change hoax appear. In a world where people are divided so radically, it is important to emphasize how negative connotations of climate change can severely impact our local and global environments. I talk about climate change at least once a day, and I believe it should be normalized in our culture to implement day to day actions that can improve our chances of saving the Earth. No effort is little, and until politics address that large corporations need to use environmentally sustainable tactics, I do not believe that the average person will be convinced that their own actions can impact the Earth drastically. It is time that socialist ideas overrule capitalist practices, and with all of the climate rallies that have been occurring around the globe recently, I have hope that this can happen before it is too late for the generation to see all the beauty that Earth has to offer.

The film “Merchants of Doubt” explores the debate about climate change from the perspective of both climate change believers and deniers. Like “A Climate of Doubt”, climate change deniers are interviewed and narrated in their process of changing public opinion. From what I remember, both films cover similar points like the Oregon Petition, the funding of organizations from the fossil fuel industry, the scientists leading the denial movement, and so on.
     <br><br>
However, this film also enlightened me in some ways because of the information provided from people with the opposing perspective. A journalist in the film draws parallels between the fossil fuel industry and the tobacco industry in connection with flame retardants, something I had never heard of before watching this. It is interesting how this chemical was marketed as necessary and harmless despite its dangers to public health, and that regulations against it were not passed because they used industry tactics to prevent a ban of it from occurring. In the same vein, the fossil fuel industry hires people and funds organizations to sway public opinion, preventing legislation that would lose them money and helping to destroy the world at the same time. Moreover, the scientists featured that read only a small portion of the explicit death threats they received exemplified just how powerful and threatening the fossil fuel industry is. The film then shows, in contrast, Marc Morano who nonchalantly admits that he contributes to those threats, showing no regret for doing such things. This follows the attitude that leaders of the climate change denial movement have had throughout the film--they only seem to care about their own self-interest, no matter the harm that is imposed on others. While people who look at the facts are trying to spread the truth, on both sides of the political spectrum, in order to preserve the planet, others are willing to destroy it, along with any obstacles along their way of making an extra buck.

The film “merchants of doubt” shows us how influential false information can be. It’s all about the political agendas of those higher up and about keeping money in their pockets. It's quite disgusting that these people can speak out against a topic that has so much evidence. They claim to “fight with facts” but they refuse to even look at the facts. They create their own to fit their beliefs. They are psychologically forced to find only data that supports what they believe to be the truth. There are still people in the film who believe that they were doing the right thing when fighting alongside big tobacco and claiming it wasn’t harmful. These people such as the lobbyists are just fighting for whatever side has the money, which will obviously be the oil companies. It is scary to me how much power they have over us without knowing. Everyone is scared of socialism and claim that this is the environmentalist's goal, but we are already living under the oil companies thumb. We are trained that we need them to live our lives, just like big tobacco got everyone addicted to their products. The idea that young environmentalists are being trained as “eco-terrorists” is crazy to me. That is completely wrong as they are the ones who are destroying this planet. 
     <br><br>

This film really taught me that you have to be suspicious of what you read and watch on tv. When they showed how the climate deniers were using the same format of past scientific papers, I was shocked. I personally as an 18-year-old, would have never been able to tell the difference. No one wants to take time to research the authors, they just want to read the paper and hear what they want. Now, I am going to be extremely cautious and pay attention to if the authors are certified or not. The lengths people will go to prove their own point is borderline psychotic.
      <br><br>
If these people continue to run our country, the US will have no chance. That is why we need to become more independent from the big oil companies and use renewable resources.

The documentary “Climate of Doubt” is talking about how climate change has become a political issue. It is not just basically talking about the environmental crisis. What we are facing right now and what the author focuses on is how the climate is being manipulated by the government or political power. Like fossil fuel or any other resource that is being used by the upper-level people.
      <br><br>
The government is negatively protecting the small number of upper people who are either rich or having political power. However, after those people used this resource from nature and made a lot of devastating impacts. The people who need to take responsibility for are not those people. But the poor and a large number of people who work for those people or did not related to those people but live in there have to endure the destroy and the crisis that those rich people assigned.
      <br><br>
There are so many parallels that can be drawn from the tobacco industry and the fossil fuel industry. Unfortunately, as a result of both, innocent people have to suffer as a cost of like they have done.

I disagree that those who need to take responsibility are the poor rather than the upper-class citizens. The upper class uses more fossil fuels and emits more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. I believe the poor should not be blamed for working for them when they simply need to make a living while their employers are very materialistic and are doing more to harm the environment. This is not to say that they are completely innocent, as Americans are one of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis, but I do not think it is right to place the majority of the blame on the lower class.

This film, "A Climate of Doubt" was really frustrating and the only reason I got through it was because the host was entertaining in the way he asked interviewees questions, as I could share his shock and curiosity. Treating climate change as “green is the new red” versus realizing how this is not a plot to increase taxes, ruin the free market, nor expanding the government, is completely selfish. It’s interesting to see how politicians changed/ toned down their views of climate change from the public pressure of debate. Given that these anti-human caused campaigns’ goal is to “create doubt. Let’s create a sense of a balanced debate, and make sure these line of skepticism become routinely a part of public discussion,” to confuse and seed doubt into the public is so harmful. We don’t have time for the politics/ economic antics. If 97% of scientists agree that climate change is human caused, calls for action and can be slowed/reversed, then this should not be concluded as ‘scientific malpractice.’

While watching “A Climate of Doubt” I couldn’t help but feel extremely angry with the things I was hearing politicians say. What’s so upsetting about it all is how much influence these people have over the opinions of others. The fact that we allow these people to even share their invalid thoughts on climate change is infuriating to me. Not only are their opinions invalid, but they share these ideas with the world and try to manipulate the thoughts people have on climate change in order to sway these people into believing and supporting what they say. If these politicians didn’t have the title they do, I doubt the things they have to say on climate change would get any recognition at all. It’s clear that their motive in influencing people to disregard all the factual evidence that has been presented on climate change is the benefit they get out of the many things that contribute to climate change. If people all around the world actually made the lifestyle changes that they should be in order to improve climate change, these politicians would lose so much. The fact that they can be so selfish to continue to try and influence others to do nothing to improve our world’s current state, simply for their own benefit, should truly be seen as a crime.

This documentary, "A Climate of Doubt," was definitely one of the most frustrating films I have watched. It was just really annoying watching how ignorant people could be to the literal facts laid out in front of them in every way possible, but they choose to stick to their pride and ego instead of factual evidence. One of the speakers in the documentary even had the audacity of stating that global warming is good for the environment, as if there are not natural disasters happening all over the world because of global warming! 
      <br><br>


Although I have to agree completely with the beliefs going against the climate crisis, I do believe it is smart of Ken to introduce us to these opposing views, specifically through this documentary. It is always good to listen to other people's beliefs even if we do not personally agree. Having Ken express his rebuttals toward this issue make his point and the whole deal with the climate crisis even stronger. I had never realized the negative effect politics actually have on this issue and on people's view in regard to it. Large groups in society have been manipulated into not believing any of the evidence and facts proving and supporting that anthropogenic climate change is at fault behind the fact that all these atrocious catastrophes across the world are getting worse and worse.

A Climate of Doubt is a striking film that follows various climate change deniers and exposes their various motivations for acting against a transition to a more sustainable way of living on earth. When watching these people talk about climate change it really seems like they believe that climate change is some great scam by all these scientists to line their pockets with all that money from mysterious sources. Only when realizing that most of these people are ironically lining their own pockets with money tarred by fossil fuel consumption do you realize their true motivation for speaking out. I think that the most dangerous thing about climate change by far is not the effects of climate change, because we know we have solutions to prevent such a problem from occurring. It is the fact that there are politicians and lobbyists that are so concerned with getting money that they are willing to harm future generations and knowingly misinform the public about this pressing issue. These politicians are throwing us and other populations into a terrible future.

How much is life worth? This question clouded my thoughts the entire time I was viewing "A Climate of Doubt". To the conservatives and fossil fuel industries, it seems that life is worth nothing compared to every dollar they get from pouring out pounds of fossil fuel. Politicians such as Myron Ebell can do nothing for our environment but provide an "I'm sorry" after they have deliberately sat by and destroyed our planet. Climate skeptics know in every sense how damaging fossil fuel industries are, yet are only "skeptical" because it earns them another dollar. It has become very apparent in this cat and mouse game of climate change advocacy, to me at least, that scientists who deny or are skeptical do so, because they get rich off of it. Climate change is not and should not be a political or social debate. It is a scientific fact. Yet it appears to be the biggest fact that has been extensively twisted and turned to try and steer people away from the truth. There will be no way to win this war until it is far too late. Unfortunately then, we will lose our planet and the beautiful life forms it created, to greed and all we will receive is an "I'm Sorry". So given the opportunity to ask a climate skeptic, I would like to ask, How much is life worth?

This same question was on my mind the whole time I was watching the film because, sadly to these massive domineering companies I don't think it is worth very much. I completely agree with you, and believe this film should absolutely be a mandatory watch for all individuals who refuse to acknowledge the issue at hand. The lobbying behind climate change is largely flawed because it is not truly in the best interest for the planet, and this needs to change because it is precisely why no action is being achieved. The most frustrating thing about this is that it flat out shouldn't be a debate- its a proven fact that our environment is being destroyed. You bring up a good point about Myron Ebell, seriously screw that guy. Our country must stop allowing these fossil fuel companies to destroy our land, and we must reject their business by using more effective forms of energy. 
      <br><br>

we must keep forcing them to confront their misguided ways by asking the sentiment, how much is life worth? maybe then hopefully someday they'll change their ways.

"Climate of Doubt" is a documentary that reveals how politics play a role in climate change. What is scary to me is that people with power and high authority are capable of swaying the publics opinions from what they present. They don't need to win the scientific argument as long as they control what they display to the public. Even influential people such as Barack Obama tried to issue the problem of our government, but groups like the Heartland Institution's wide distribution of false information makes the task not simple and continually frames scientists as conspirators. They say that the consensus of  climate change is non-scientific, but a political one. Climate realists need to do a better job of communicating the science behind it. And for the rest of us, what we can do is we need to spread the existence of such consensus around us through social media. The lack of public awareness is what is damaging us and the denialist know it.

A Climate of Doubt was difficult to watch as I would consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable on the topic of climate change due to years of various classes relating to the environment and my own passion on the issue. One point in the film that was especially disturbing was when one of the interviewees called his denial towards climate change “common sense.” He proceeded to explain his logic in full confidence, explaining that our climate is constantly fluctuating, thus no real increase can be detected. This logic, however, is so incredibly backwards and far from my idea of common sense. Having “common sense” would mean looking at our patterns as humans along with these changes in climate. There is no logical way to look at habitat destruction, pollution, the excessive release of greenhouse gases, and the countless other types of destructive human action and not consider that our environment could be affected. Although the documentary was fairly neutral and focused more on presenting opinions without rejecting them, I could not stop myself from becoming frustrated with some of the arguments made by interviewees. When the economy was brought up, I remembered a point that someone brought up during lecture, which explained that the economic argument is illegitimate because, if change is not made, the economy will not even exist as it does now. I believe the same person explained how the preservation of our environment would actually create jobs, as major changes, such as the addition of solar panels or improving cities to be more environmentally friendly, require a significant amount of workers to be achieved. I completely agree with this individual, as I find it irresponsible to use job loss as a reason to oppose environmentalism. It is often brought up in the climate crisis discussion that the least privileged people, as with most issues, will be hurt the most by the effects of climate change. Those who are wealthy will continue to live lavishly because they can afford to keep these issues at bay in their own lives. An example that comes to mind in regards to this idea is when the Kardashian family hired their own private firefighters to stop one of the many Southern California fires from reaching their mansions. A poor family would never have this privilege of protecting themselves from the consequences of climate change. I understand that the economy is an important aspect of the climate crisis, but I hate to see people manipulated into denying change based on the fear of losing their jobs and putting their families at risk. One of the best points in the film, in my opinion, was when Bob Inglis brought up the analogy of the sick child, with 98 doctors giving the same prescription, and only 2 in favor of another method. This analogy was used to represent the 98% of scientists who argue in favor of the existence of climate change, with only 2% who have opposing views. When Inglis made this argument, I can’t imagine still being in denial of the existence of climate change. At this point, we don’t even need to blindly trust scientists, as we can easily see the consequences of climate change unfolding in front of us: increased fires, flooding, the melting of the Polar ice caps, sea level rise, and many, many more. In 2020, denying climate change is simply being ignorant to an issue that can not be ignored any longer. I sincerely hope that these people have since realized the severity of the climate crisis before it is too late.

The film was very interesting to say the least. I still find it hard to believe that people are trying very hard to debunk climate change. People will go to the extreme to make sure that they have support against climate change. The whole time I was watching the film I was just seeing mostly white men. Throughout the film the majority of the time all I saw was white men which was really troubling. The film made me realize how many people actually do not believe that climate is an actual thing. The part that was crazy to see was the part in which politicians were cast aside if they believed in climate change. It was like if believing in climate change was harmful and worst thing they could do. Clearly climate change has become a very political issue which shouldn’t have in the first place. Climate change should not be a political issue. Climate should not be about politics. Climate change should be about the reality of what is at stake. It is clearly an issue that applies to everything which is why it is so important. Having this issue being viewed as political is just doing damage. Another thing that was not surprising at all that the film talked about was being funded by companies like Exon which is a fossil fuel company

For me, representation has always been a strong factor in giving things the recognition they deserve. Apart from the obvious lack of POC in the film,  what caught my attention was the age representation that this film showed holds a strong opinion on the skeptics behind climate change. Ok boomer will probably be the most outplayed metaphor in this class but it stands because all of the people that were included in this film could not possibly have been under 40 years old. This film sheds light on how the oil industry has created the issue of climate change in America to be a political issue through the funding of beliefs which is probably the most frustrating issue I have with the rejection of climate change. Most importantly, this film frustrates me because it makes me feel and believe that this issue is, in my opinion, a race war. Now, we have representatives like AOC and Ilhan Omar to fight for our rights regarding the climate crisis but before them, there was not one POC who was showing those who are underrepresented, low-income communities, and un-educated with the logistics regarding political issues which would affect a huge part of the American population. In the movie "A Climate of Doubt," the majority are once again being stifled by the minority in this case, 97% of scientists who have developed a consensus on the belief that humans are directly affecting the Earth's climate change issue have been successfully countered by the 3% because of funding from big corporations, manipulation of media by feeding the public distasteful images that discredit those who try and support climate change. In the end, "A Climate of Doubt" shows me how the American public is strategically manipulated and pitted against each other for the financial benefit of corporations and their political beneficiaries.

What really stood out to me about this film was just the amount of people who really don’t believe in Climate Change.  It isn’t often that I see people talking about it like this.  We hear about deniers, I’ve read fake news articles, but I haven’t heard and seen many people talk about it so blatantly.  It’s shocking to me that people can take what is literally factual information, and twist it into something that they want to hear.  For example, taking the graph data and showing only a small portion of the overall picture can easily twist the truth.  This is how they spread lies, and fake information and make the rest of the population believe it.  Things like, “global warming is good,” and “CO2 is good,” these are such half-truths.  It is so unfortunate to me that money has such an unhealthy impact on people.  The fossil fuel industry is so corrupt, funding all these conferences and speakers so that they will share false information.  Everything is motivated by money, which is why I think it is so true (while unfortunate) that we will only truly see a change in human action against climate change by taxing and potentially rewarding through monetary values. 

      <br><br>

Another thing that continues to shock me throughout this movie as well as the article that we read for this week, is that 97% doesn’t convince people.  But as I think that Inglis puts it well, if your child was dying of a disease, and 97 doctors had one way to fix it, but 3 thought differently, who would you believe?  I think he put it in a really effective and well thought out analogy because in essence, that is exactly what the older generations are doing, and what we have the potential to do.  The lives of our children are literally in our hands, we are being told by 97 scientists how to help them, but 3 disagree.  Who are we going to believe?

"Climate of Doubt" was comedy to me. It is crazy that people think like this. I think there was a woman for claimed that we need carbon dioxide. In all the laughter, there were thoughts that never escaped me. For example, I did think about how this issue has been heavily politicized to ultimately benefit special interest groups and fossil fuel industries. This issue should not be politicized but seen as an emergency. I can only hope that this country elect the right person to enact policies but all this misinformation makes me feel hopeless.

This documentary is a perfect stepping-stone into showing the reality of American politics, and how misinformation gets spread. As John Kerry states plain and simple, money influences people. It is truly frustrating that there are people out there willing to spread misinformation about such a massive topic such as climate change, and it's even more frustrating that there are people out there that give credence to these claims, such as Bill Cook. Bill read Fred Singer’s book, and just because it appeared “very factual” and just because the studies made sense to him, he believes in it. A statement as simple as CO2 is a good thing because plants need it was enough to convince him that CO2 in the atmosphere, no matter the amount apparently, is good. This oversimplification of science is disgusting, and those who attempt to use it in this way is shameful. We see this in data pertaining to cooling trends, where people pick out certain years that reflect a cooling trend, when in reality the data as a whole shows that temperatures are increasing every single decade. Unfortunately I think our education system has a lot to do with why misinformation and fake news is such a problem. Nobody is really taught to consider all arguments and sides. We just tend to hear something that sounds good and accept it as true, and put down those who disagree with us, such as in the case of Inglis, who was slandered and lost an election 79% to 21% all because he said he agrees with the notion that humans are causing climate change. It's disheartening to see someone affected so negatively in this way. I hope that those who believe in climate change, and those who do not, can come to have an open dialogue where they can discuss climate change in a rational, respectful manner, but I won’t hold my breath. People are too sensitive these days. They hate being told their wrong, they hate accepting they are wrong, and they seem to hate changing their minds despite mountains of evidence. We all need to get smart, find the facts, and change.

Whenever you see a bad guy in a movie it's almost always the person that looks like a monster, the bad guy in this documentary was Christopher Monckton with his bug eyes. Anyways I find it dumb how climate skeptics call themselves rebels just because they're going against a larger group of people that believe that climate change is real. I don't know why they would call their situation "David versus Goliath" when the real Goliath is climate change and the actual rebels are the people that are trying to stop this crisis. What these people really want is for the economy to flourish, that is why they hated the cap and trade that was introduced because it took people's jobs away and the economy was slow. What these skeptics don't realize is that if we allow them to continue abusing the earth of its natural resources then the economy is going to worsen along with the stability of the earth. I found it interesting when the documentary mentioned the Climategate emails because it basically showed skeptics that most of the information that they have been using was fabricated by scientists that were probably paid to do so by large corporations. I also found it interesting that when these scientists and skeptics were talking about the general trend of temperatures in a ten year span, it showed that the temperature was declining, however it was actually increasing throughout time with moments of decrease followed by increases in the temperature. 
      <br><br>
You guys should watch the South Park episode about Al Gore and "Man Bear Pig", the documentary mentioned how Al Gore was very controversial which didn't make him that believable to skeptics and this Episode of South Park does an excellent job in showing this. Man Bear Pig is a metaphor for climate change, it's this demon that kills people because of what past generations did. This relates to how the cause of this climate crisis is due to older generations and that the newer and younger generations are left to deal with it.

The documentary “Merchants of Doubt” presented us with the stories behind the other side of the debate on climate change, and whether it is human caused. As I learned from this week’s lecture video, many of those organizations who believe climate change is not happening and not caused by humans were mostly connected with large corporations, such as oil companies like Exxon. I felt very annoyed about the attitude of these organizations and their so called “experts” have toward the scientists and science. From my perspective, all I can see is how they are twisting the truth about this urgent issue and spreading false information to the public which then results in serious consequences such as the decrease of public awareness, brainwashing people into believing that climate change is not happening and unimportant.
      <br><br>

Unfortunately, these are the ones who are continuously receiving attention while the real scientists are being ignored or even criticized, many of them had been threatened by death via blackmailing only because they spoke out the truth and showed us their evidence. This made me believe that what we need to do now is not only taking action, but also speak out. Educating people around us and our community to understand how severe the situation had become, and introduce steps we could take to reduce the damage we might face in the future.

The documentary “Climate of Doubt” talks about how climate change has become a political issue rather than an environmental problem. 97% of scientists believe in climate change and recognize that it is a huge problem that needs to be combatted. However, there are skeptical people out there that continue to question the validity of hard science. The skeptics include: big oil companies. I mean it makes sense, why would they support the climate change movement when they are the reasons it started in the first place. Big oil companies are big contributors to climate change, releasing huge amounts of fossil fuels into the atmosphere. Oil production is a million dollar business, supporting America's richest politicians. 
      <br><br>
With money involved, climate change has become a political issue. With the highly influential platform that politicians have, they have continued to manipulate people for years. They are in denial of the effects of climate change, claiming that it is a "hoax." In a society where many are quick to believe the information spread through social media, many are susceptible to believe these politicians. 
      <br><br>
While the fossil fuel and oil companies drastically benefit our economy, they continue to destroy our planet. While money is important, our environment should be the primary priority. We only have one planet, and if we cannot continue to mistreat mother nature.
      <br><br>
Earth cannot be replaced, and we must all combat the climate crisis in order to ensure a sustainable future.

After watching the documentaries, I believe that perhaps even the scientists that say climate change is not a big deal are fooled themselves. Scientists are not all directly connected to the studies that were done on the climate and therefore can be swayed. If a scientist believe that climate change is not a big deal then they would push that idea the same as we are. I believe that the issue we face is drastic and many people, billions of people are at the mercy of a few countries. These politicians, however, that are driving these fossil fuel industry goals and knowingly doing it should be arrested for spreading false information because their lies are killing the planet and will lead to the death of our species. The damage will be catastrophic as we are already seeing insane numbers of extinction. The oceans are dying and acidifying while our air pollutes with CO2 and the land is filled with trash and other undesirables. The Climate of Doubt was a bit frustrating to see how these people are leading the world to being uninhabitable to save their empires.

"A Climate of Doubt" provides an inside look into the viewpoints of climate skeptics. When watching the film, I was anticipating to learn about the data used in many of the arguments made by those who deny global warming. However, this film revealed that much of the "data" being used by these skeptics were in fact skewed to fit their own agenda. One example is the use of falsifying global temperature patterns to show that the Earth's average temperature has been decreasing over the past decades. For someone who is unfamiliar with scientific data, or for any average person, this graph can easily be convincing. It is upsetting to know that such false information can be easily spread and believed by unsuspecting people who are simply looking for the truth. Furthermore, this example serves as a reminder that we must be cautious when looking at data that is being presented, regardless if it comes from a group that necessary sides with your own personal beliefs. I believe that this can idea can be further driven by the fact that much of the research published by climate change skeptics are funded by companies that would be economically ruined by findings that would support the idea of continuous global warming caused by anthropogenic causes. 
      <br><br>
What further upset me was seeing how the climate change issues shifted from being an environmental topic into a divisive argument rooted in economic and political differences. As shown in the film, many people living in the generally more conservative areas in the United States were upset with President Obama's cap and trade policy. Although this policy was put in place to protect the environment, people were upset with the idea of paying more taxes. Without environmental protection, what jobs will remain in the future? If there isn't a clear path towards a healthier, more sustainable environment within the following decades, the economic infrastructure of the United States will not experience growth. While the environmental debate should not be one based solely on economic and political opinions, it is clear that changes to our political structure is needed to created the immediate changes necessary to create a sustainable future.

I thought the topic of this docu-episode was novel, and I was excited to understand an angle of the climate crisis that is not often explored (as I learned, this is probably due to political and financial obstacles). Tying together the intellectual fields of science and politics is an action that does not get analyzed enough, and after watching this film, I felt disheartened. It seems as though policy making concerning environmental issues may never escape this stagnant stronghold that climate change naysayers have been pushing. I found the section of the film that discussed media and ad campaigns that were used to spread misinformation about climate change to be particularly alarming. Being a communication major, whose passion lies in media effects and persuasion, I was particularly curious about these campaigns. Moreover, I hope that these types of campaigns are brought up and dissected more throughout the quarter, as I believe that media is becoming a tool of vital importance all parties’ involved in the climate crisis.

I was really triggered after watching Climate of Doubt. Anthropogenic climate change should not be a debate between the people. There is nothing to prove wrong when we have all of the facts are right in front of us.Yes it is nice that we have scientist confirming what we see proving that climate change is a real problem. We see the change in temperature, the rise in natural disasters and we didn’t know why so the scientist looked at the temperature trends over several decades. Out of the entire documentary I was bothered with Fred Singer’s comments on climate change. How is someone so educated going to say that climate change is not real and is a hoax? How is he going to only use ten years of this planet’s life to describe its trend? His comments really surprised me because he is a physicist and emeritus professor of environmental science in Virginia. This planet is millions of years, it is impossible to describe a trend by only using ten years of this planets. When he said that second hand smoke was not a real thing made me lose it. I was over the documentary I could listen to anything else he had to say. He is just ignorant to the events that are happening around him. I just hope that he isn’t spreading any wrong information to his students. Professors make a huge impact on students thinking because we trust our professor to inform us about credible information.

To me, this seems like an appeal to the far right. The issue is that these companies have claims to enormous amounts of money and have built their businesses off the assumption that they will be able to realize these claims. As Ken mentioned, many businesses have huge amounts of stock in fossil fuel companies. For example, Chase keeps about 90% of their investments in fossil fuels. To make the issue bigger, many conservatives will sympathize with the fossil fuel interests. They view necessary regulation as oppression, even if it is a fact that something needs to be done or people will die. They fail to realize that unless they are "opressed," millions and millions of people will die. How would one compensate the fossil fuel interests for the work they have put into finding and capitalizing on these fossil fuel claims? It is a difficult question with no good answer, the money has to come from somewhere.

Merchants Of Doubt
       <br><br>

97% of scientists confirmed that climate change is mainly caused by human activities which have already considered as a fact for the human. Large polluting companies such as American oil have inherited the tricks from tobacco companies, hired somebody to disguise themselves as so-called “professionals” to form a third-party organization to confuse the public, and publicized different reasons to make the facts, which recognized by the global scientific community, seeming controversial, or intimidated the public to "protect a free life style". They also turned scientific issues into political issues. Some lobbyists were employed at different times by many different pollution industries, surprisingly and disgustingly they even admitted their distorted thinking happily in the film. That kind of mind really made me sick and cringe. Climate change is a moral issue that science should not allow capital to influence results.

I found myself visibly expressing my disbelief, embarrassment, and shock throughout “A Climate of Doubt.” Representatives of the Heartland Institute completely undermined the research done by thousands of specialized scientists and made comments along the lines of “Carbon dioxide is plant food” and claimed that trends in climate are not identifiable. Statements like these are almost laughable. Of course, a 5th grader can acknowledge how photosynthesis works in its simplest form, and yes, CO2 is necessary for this biological process. But how can one disregard all common sense and state that climate change does not exist and increasing CO2 in the atmosphere is not an emerging concern because “CO2 is plant food.” This is an example of a post hoc fallacy. Essentially these deniers are following the logic that “CO2 is essential for plant and human life, therefore the increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere is a healthy phenomenon.” … cool story… but what does this contribute to the argument of climate change. The elementary comments that these deniers are making have no relevance in the big picture, or looking into earth’s future. Fred Singer also claims that there are no trends of warming, but I thought a really good point that “Frontline” made is that one can pick whatever starting and end points in their timeline of data to fit the agenda they want to support. Deniers of climate change can identify periods of cooling over a decade, but fail to look at the overall period of warming over centuries. This was described as “going down an up elevator.”
       <br><br>

There are holes in all of Heartland’s (along with other conservative think tanks) contrived arguments. Hardly do you find that their statements are based on independent research, and the platform is built off of debunking climate change research that otherwise would have a majority consensus. It is clear that assemblies such as the International Conference of Climate Change are not genuine when its main proponents say they are “fighting against the expansion of government.” They have no interest in finding the truth in the science of climate change and educating the American people of this truth. Their motivation is simply to create doubt; deniers fear a consensus. Clear consensus of the public is a threat to individual freedom, because then there is a gateway for “big government” to step in and tax Americans and cap CO2 emissions; a nightmare for big corporations, many of which fund these climate hoax theories and successfully lobby politicians and scientists.
       <br><br>

What I realized in this film is that basically all of climate change doubt can be traced back to  big oil and gas corporations like ExxonMobil. They act in self interest, which is no surprise, but at the expense of entire generations of people and the health of our planet. It is a scary thought to have that the public opinion and policy are in the hands of a few wealthy corporations that benefit from exploiting the earth’s resources. After watching this film it is hard to not feel like a pawn in a game of climate change politics, and hard to decipher what public information can be trusted.



</p><hr>


<p>
I've said it before and I'm going to say it again, it's not at all surprising to see that the extreme greediness of these major companies are causing them to sacrifice the future of the planet in order to keep their pocketbooks full. Why accept that your actions are doing harm when you can continue to make billions of dollars per year by ignoring the facts?

       <br><br>

In "A Climate of Doubt," this only becomes more evident as the video goes on. When Christopher Monckton referred to the excess amount of CO2 in our atmosphere at "plant food," it showed how the climate skeptics are treating the impending climate crisis as a joke. Yes, it might be funny now while the effects aren't as extreme, but in the future, when climate change has gravely affected everything from food supply to the overall survival of the human race, it won't be as funny anymore, will it? As we reach the point of no return, it is increasingly important for politicians to stop with the (terrible) humor and realize the vast and dangerous effects that Big Oil and other-related industries are wreaking havoc with. 
       <br><br>


What's even worse than the conscientious ignorance of the (mainly conservative) climate deniers is the dissemination of information that directly targets the uneducated population of America. When one lacks a solid, even rudimentary understanding of science (or education in general), it opens up the possibility for large and powerful companies to bombard them with "facts and statistics" that on a surface level sound creditable. For example, this is seen in the feature when one of the committees against climate change legislation promoted a video touting the "benefits" of carbon dioxide. This is ultimately what's lead to the rise in support against the acceptance of climate change, as sadly as it sounds.

The fact that the republican people were more concerned about the heightening of taxes than the death of the planet made me very concerned for the American people as a whole. Singer used false evidence of science by only showing a ten year span of global temperature levels which appeared to be cooling. But, if you look at the bigger picture the temperatures are cooling by small amounts and then increasing again. So, when you look at the last century, you see that the planet is in fact warming. This man is responsible for a lot of opinions based on the denial of climate change. The evidence that those people have is not even based on scientific evidence. This includes falsified and stolen emails between scientists, testimonies of nonexperts, and bills and petitions that were endorsed by corporations. I find it very sad that people still try and make the survival of the human race a political battle that is to be won. This film showed a lot of the corruption of politics and what power hungry people will do and say for money even if it isn’t true and could physically harm many.  A very compelling quote from the movie that stuck with me was when the scientist Schmidt said, “you cannot legislate away climate change.”

<p>
I didn’t know that people who are opposed to climate change have a very systematic approach to advertising. When skeptics say that carbon dioxide is plant food, they are implying that the increase of carbon dioxide is beneficial to the life of plants. Their arguments can appear to be quite compelling. And, admittedly, some people may follow their arguments and start to be skeptical about climate change. As soon as people create doubt in themselves, the goal of the advertising is reached, but have they thought about plants’ sensitivity to the fluctuations of temperature? What about ocean acidification led by the increase of CO2 and its effect on coral bleaching? What about the breathing of humans and animals?



</p><hr>


<p>
I am genuinely stunned that climate change can be seen as a good, as one speaker said in "A Climate of Doubt". I understand that carbon dioxide is necessary for plant life, as it is their source of nutrients, but there is also "overeating" to be concerned about. Soon the environment that these plants live in will be overrun by natural disasters, housing for overpopulated regions, and inhumane temperatures. Climate change is going to affect the newer generations, the minorities, and the impoverished communities. Older white males can be oblivious to the repercussions of global warming because it ultimately won't affect them that much. Most of the speakers in this Frontline documentary were older white men with no real scientific qualifications claiming that climate change is a political scheme or irrelevant or inevitable. Their claims that these issues, all results from climate change, are hyped up makes me sick to my stomach. It was even proved that you can "play games with data" to make it seem like temperatures haven't changed at all. Only asking Republicans about disproving climate change is a biased game and based purely on opinion and not acknowledging scientific statistics. I am exhausted by the politicians of the world claiming that climate change is a political scheme when in reality it affects everyone.

To me, A Climate of Doubt was haunting to watch because I had previously not understood the blatant dishonesty of climate skeptics. Watching footage from the convention was horrifying because it seems so obviously propaganda but people still are not able to see through it. I was particularly bothered by  Fred Singer's claims that, "Climate, to me, has become a non issue. It's a phantom issue. There is nothing wrong with the climate..." If he is as qualified as he claims to be, then he most certainly knows that climate change is a valid issue that is exacerbated by anthropogenic factors. He is deliberately misleading the public to support fossil fuel industries and conservative policy. He is abusing his title because he knows that it will legitimize his claims even if they are false. I hate that the public is so vulnerable to people like this. This film was very valuable for me to see because it contextualized the political side of the climate change issue for me. I was not aware that prior to 2010, there was a fair amount of conservative recognition of climate change. This film offered me a better timeline of the issue and showed me what has caused it to worsen to today's extent. The issue became politicized and it pained me to watch skeptics crucify Al Gore and destroy the legitimacy of the environmentalist movement.  It angers me to watch people who are trying to prevent further climate change be dismissed as "Alarmists". Many conservative/ libertarian Americans were unbothered by climate change activism until the Obama era where policies were suggested that they felt infringed on their freedom. These skeptics were disengaged from the issue until it seemed like they had something of their own at stake. This film exposed to me the underbelly of American politics and the fact that much of it is manipulated by external forces with large funding. It scares me that the strings of government are often pulled by rich industries with very little concern for the long term ramifications of their actions. Although I liked the film and recognize its value, I felt uncomfortable during it because of the downright shadiness of politicians and climate change skeptics in the United States.

"Merchants of Doubt"-        <br><br>

The amount of deceit in this one film is quite astounding! And it’s not the fact that those speaking are being deceitful, but rather the people who care continuously claiming that climate change is not real. What made me most upset was that these executives for tobacco, alcohol, and oil companies plus more were aware of all the harmful affects their plants and factories were having on the general public as well as our atmosphere yet they preferred people be harmed and live with the consequences than lose economic gains.
       <br><br>

There is one particular quote that stuck through me throughout this whole film, and it was said by science historian Naomi Oreskes who commented that climate change “is a debate, but not a scientific debate.” This rang so true to me because when facing what all the media presents about climate change, the topic is not argued without bringing up economic loss and politicians. The topic of climate change has sadly become a political debate based more on opinion and how someone will benefit economically rather than what the facts are clearly stating. As a skeptic who became a believer of climate change states in the film, “Data trumps politics”, and while this is apparent to so many it is not a rule followed by those denying what’s happening to our planet. I think the question to be asked now is, how do we fight something as abstract as doubt? Because that is the most scary thing that these CEOs are succeeding at and that is planting the seed of doubt in the public’s mind.

“Merchant of Doubt” truly showed the extents of human selfishness and the consequences that greed inflicts on others. It is disgusting how corporations will stop at nothing to increase profits, even when they know it is causing harm to their consumers. When scientists discovered the harmful effects of tobacco, the corporations decided to ignore it and continue selling the product. In order to continue sales, they knew they needed to plant a seed of doubt in their consumer’s minds about whether or not those anti-tobacco claims were credible or not. With propaganda and ads, that’s exactly what they did. This is reminiscent of what climate denying organizations did in order to create doubt around the validity of the climate crisis. In addition, the part where the tobacco corporations scapegoated non-fire proof furniture truly shows the depths of its corruption. 
       <br><br>

Doubt is truly one of the best methods to encourage stagnation. It already takes a lot for people to decide and begin to change. However, if they start doubting the cause they are supposed to support, the likelihood of them actually changing drops by a lot. There are so many parallels that can be drawn from the tobacco industry and the fossil fuel industry. Unfortunately, as a result of both, innocent people have to suffer as a cost of their greed.

I really enjoyed watching the documentary "Climate of Doubt" and how it presented the ways that climate skeptics would gather and present data that could be used to further push their agenda. I found it interesting that it addressed that anyone can frame any set of data to give and present the results desired and anyone can formulate an official appearing consensus on anything if you tweak the parameters of your study. This is why I am skeptical of studies that are done by very politically charged groups or individuals, left or right, as often times research is done to confirm a pre-existing conclusion instead of conducting impartial research and formulating a conclusion and opinion based on that research. In my opinion, It is very important to look into a study's methodology to determine whether the conclusion suggested by the research is based on credible and intellectually honest research standards or if the way the study was conducted was designed in a way to present a conclusion that may be misleading.

The documentary “A Climate of Doubt” opened my eyes to how people, especially Americans, give in to style over substance. The goals of fossil fuel industries and climate change deniers and skeptics come with deadly consequences to both humans and all other forms of life on the planet. However, they do not present themselves as murderers or off-the-rails conspiracy theorists; rather, for the most part, they look and act like everyone else. They are our neighbors and community members, speaking their arguments in a civilized tone, persuading people that climate change is a hoax by presenting themselves as “one of you.” For example, the film highlighted deniers such as Myron Ebell and Christopher Monckton, both who display themselves in a civil, educated manner and swiftly apply anti-climate change rhetoric to their public speeches. This presentation is a factor in the large amount of people who are confused or are doubting the validity of the climate crisis. As a result, it is important for the public to look beyond style and instead focus on the content of the arguments presented before them.

 I very much agree with your comment. I too watched the documentary "A Climate of Doubt" and was alarmed to see just how indifferent fossil fuel companies and their supporters were to the deadly impacts that their businesses are having on the planet. The people denying the existence of the climate crisis for their personal agendas are among us acting like normal people. Many of these climate crisis deniers are even in political or large financial power, yet they choose to hide their wrongful actions from the public eye. I was particularly angered when the documentary mentioned the existence of these "middle man" type of organizations that are tailored to protect the donations of larger companies and politicians who support the denial of the climate crisis. These organizations help deniers of the climate crisis hide their actions because they are fully aware of the social repercussions that come with killing our planet.

The documentary “Climate of Doubt” just demonstrates a very fundamental concept in microeconomics — companies make profits. For fossil companies, they do their best the maximize their profits, regardless of how many people are losing home and are forced to relocate. 
        <br><br>

To me, the deniers of anthropogenic climate change are just like their puppets, being funded to try their best to spread their cynical denial of those scientific research along with their conspiracy theories. They can speak so loud because of the supports from those fossil fuel companies. Meanwhile, some of them might not even be aware of that; some of them are overconfident and pretentious to be the truth holder that can discredit the existing data with their shallow understanding and knowledge.
        <br><br>

All I wish is that most people can be more rationale, objectively thinking about whether scientific consensus is more reliable than those personal and even made-up stories and theories. After all, when it is too late, all those skeptics can say is “sorry.”

I really liked your relation to such a concept. It is hard for me to believe that companies would risk the sustainability of the earth just for a "temporary" thing. Money won't last forever, it's value fluctuates, but the Earth is in danger even though it will last longer than any of us and our values. The simple ignorance of so much people is nothing short of frustrating.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you! Some of them are definitely aware of what their actions are doing to the planet, yet their greed will not let them stop any time soon. Others are in complete denial over the situation because they want to believe that there is no harm in their actions and only support themselves with studies that agree with their points. Either way, there are fueled by their ambitions to make tons of money while others will suffer greatly at their expense. It is so sad to see these companies be responsible for the majority of carbon emissions yet do nothing to even make the slightest change for the better of humanity and earth as a whole. These companies  are just plain evil as they continue to profit and make more money then they even need. It is baffling how these companies and their higher-ups are totally fine with damaging the environment to the point of no return, yet do not realize this will affect the way their children and children's children. I really hope they can one day wake up from their greed and realize the real cost of ruining the world before it is too late.

After watching, “A Climate of Doubt” I’m simply in utter disgust and disbelief. It was truly hard to watch all fifty three minutes of it. The whole film just proves that American politics are corrupt, and some people will just believe whatever they want to believe even with so much evidence as long as it benefits them. It is really unfair that this type of information is spread to people who are misinformed. It’s really crazy to see some people who have no knowledge in the matter completely disregard and blatantly ignore actual scientists and their work. While scrolling through the comments I was happy to see a lot of others talk about Myron Ebell and his comment, because it also made me really annoyed. When asked what would happen if the climate skeptics were wrong, his response was only “I would be sorry” It is so sad to see that these people don’t care about our future at all. I think this is how they all feel and it’s terrible. Like his “apology” could undo his efforts to make people believe it isn’t real. Climate change should not be a political warfare but rather be recognized and valued by everyone because it will ultimately affect all of us!!

As an incredibly progressive individual, the majority of the men in this video represented the exact kind that I actively try to take down in my everyday life. The hypocrisy alone was both laughable and infuriating. The hypocrisy in conjunction with the idiocy strongly reaffirmed my own values. The fact that these individuals could create a movement to undo the work of millions of scientists, governments, and individuals across the world based on the notion of protecting the American dream made me utterly ashamed to be an American.  One quote that was especially astounding to me was the climate denier that said that we need to keep putting carbon dioxide in the air because it is “plant food” in front of Congress. It is amazing to me that not only could the time of our country's government be spent listening to a phrase like this but that many of our leaders are buying this bullshit. Another phrase that left me taken aback by its stupidity was the oxymoron said by this same guy, that is that we must have the “courage to do nothing,” what was more astonishing was that these world leaders were taking this literally and excitedly. I am ashamed.
        <br><br>
Another hypocrisy that was highlighted in this film, and that was not lost on me, was these deniers' criticism of the left for making climate change a political issue.  At the beginning of the film, the deniers were speaking about how the left has taken the idea of climate change, blown it out of proportion, and used it for political gain.  Following this criticism, they turned around and did the same thing but for the right with phrases like “reducing emissions is cover for reducing freedom.” Even worse they made this a polarizing issue for the right-wing, so much so that you could not be a member of the party without denying climate change, as exemplified by Bob Inglis.  We need to get these people out of the minds of other Americans and out of the decision making rooms of our country!!

Some people are trying to throw it back to 1633 and put Galileo in jail. The discrediting of scientists because they, at the end of their extensive observations and research, came up with a conclusion you didn't like is surprisingly common among a lot of people. The ability to pawn off research in favor of your own limited knowledge on a subject is ridiculous. For example, when misinformation spread about "vaccines causing autism", a lot of people elected not to vaccinate their children. This caused a bunch of problems, including the resurfacing of diseases and infections that had almost exited the human populace. Similarly, when misinformation denying anthropologenic climate change is spread, people can listen and choose to not believe in it, surfacing all kinds of problems. 
        <br><br>

"A Climate of Doubt" showed how the spread of information did not fly freely, but was instead guided by targeted politics. Basing the problem in the root of big fossil fuel business, businessmen who donate large sums of money to certain political parties have their interests tucked in the back pocket of the government. When fossil fuel finance fuels the laws that govern regulations on the climate, the climates best interest is not the most important factor. This being said, the groups that accept fossil fuel money as donations are the political groups that have to make pro fossil fuel legislation. This causes a firm divide in the wants and wishes of different people. People involved in the fossil fuel using political sector will listen to whatever climate denying business comes down to them, while people outside of this sector can view it more objectively and realize that it is happening, and we have to do something about it.

The film “Merchants Of Doubt” uses analogy of the trick of magic to show what the fossil fuel corporative and their think tanks are doing. The fact that climate change is happening is unquestionable and it is indeed caused by human activities. Alternating our current situation means a completely change in our society. One major parts that will be affected and its interest will be damaged is the fossil fuel industry. In order to protect their interest, the big oil companies are doing exactly what the cigarettes companies did in the past 50 years: creates deceptions and distraction.

        <br><br>

Fossil fuel companies never consider the consequences of their action. The only thing they care is their interest. In fact, they turn climate crisis into a political issue. In order to make people continue using petroleum, the fossil fuel companies tried everything to persuade people that climate change is a fraud. They bribed politicians and media to debate about the veridicality of climate change while it is happening. Climate change is neither a political issue or a scientific theory. It is a current fact and it will continue and be worse. The reason why we are still doing nothing is the negative side of our humanity.

        <br><br>

What really grieved me is that our inaction is because of our selfishness and carelessness. The reason that politicians and lawmakers still not regulate the oil industry is the public do no want to change. I believe many people are aware of the consequences of climate change, but they are not willing to change because it will affect their lives. If we want to stop climate change, we need to reduce or even prohibit the use of fossil fuel, which means the increase in costs and inconvenience in our lives. People do not want to eat lease delicious food because of carbon tax and cannot visit beautiful place because they can’t use cars. Human is not only intelligent but also  stupid and shortsighted. We are not willing to give up what we have in order to change, even though changing is a much better option for us.

        <br><br>

People will eventually realize the climate crisis and treat it as a severe problem. We will change someday. It is just a matter of time. However, when we will change is a crucial problem. Just like the lady said in the documentary, we might not have another 50 years to change because all the complementary actions will be too late then.

Rich, old, white, men. I have watched both these documentaries before, and yet the one thing that I took away from them this viewing, as opposed to my previous, is that almost every player in them is an old, white man, with significant socioeconomic influence in regard to climate and the fossil fuel industry. Furthermore, I find particular interest in the fact that “Climate of Doubt” in particular is centered around the election of Barack Obama and his initial push for climate legislation. With the fact that climate change will disproportionately effect communities of color, and black and brown people around the world, I find it particularly interesting and disgusting that the election of “the black president” encourages such a response from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests, which are the rich, old, white men playing poker with our world.

I was really upset on the responses which governments and politicians make for climate crisis after watching "A Climate of Doubt" and "Merchants of Doubt". Those fossil fuel companies or big industrial companies are seen as climate deniers. They are acting like they have never seen the situations of climate crisis or how those unfortunate people in poor regions are suffering from the results they are not supposed to take responsibilities. The most ironic thing is at the same time those big industries are calculating how much profits they could make from evacuating underground resources. They are careless about other lives on Earth. The only thing they have is greed. The final goal of these fossil-fuel industries is to hide all the truth and climate problems behind in order to maximize their profits. The saddest thing is when i see some politicians involving with these industries. Instead of stopping these greedy companies, those politicians join them and help to convince people climate crisis is not a human-made issue and making people to believe there is no problem of using their products. When the public is convinced, then it will be easily controlled. These people are selfish, with no sense of responsibility. They only desire how much profits they can make. They never care about other living creatures on our planet including themselves.

I found the documentary of "A Climate of Doubt," interesting while also seemingly frustrating. Made in the early 2010's, most of the inaction and stagnant policy being pushed for holds largely the same today. It demonstrated the shifts in divisiveness with an issue such as climate change. It began to show how viewing of the issue along the 'left' side agreed heavily with the ideas of man made climate change, while the 'right' side was made up more of deniers if you will, or those interested with a more 'lassiez-faire' approach or little government interaction interfering with business. Although at one point or another, it's almost as if something's gotta give. With the reelection of Bob Inglis, as a Republican candidate, he was asked about his opinion on climate change. Answering largely against his platform, his election results with a stark divide of 21 to his opponents 79, were sharp. Therefore helping to illustrate the divides taken by such an issue. This can be further seen with the ideas of climate-gate, North-Carolinean estimates, personification of this issue by Al Gore and loss by Inglis', as information to stark the fire on climate change, not caused by humans. When Gore took up such an issue like that of Climate Change, comments from individuals in opposition were incredibly happy, as it just wasn't an issue, but something they could tie back to an individual to attack and exploit. I found it interesting how they included the debate on 'always cooling' as used by those not believing in man made climate change, and then contrast it with tables showing that while over the period of a decade cooling takes place, over a number of decades, the temperature has increased greatly. This in addition to Exxon's involvement with the Heartland Institute was intriguing as well.

Like I said in many of comments before, I believe Global Warming is a serious but not the one we should focus on right now. The rise of CO2 isn’t yet really hurt the planet, and the rise of it isn’t just starting in hundreds of years but started from the time when livings appear on the Earth. All we have currently is still in normal range, and I personally do believe it will get over range in next thousands of years if human still exist at that time. However, none of those predictions have validated reasons that can prevent us from emitting CO2. The behavior of reducing CO2 is like the behavior that I still have five kids to feed, and I don’t really have money to buy them food, but I am starting to worry if feeding my kids too many times will make them lazy and fat. How funny is that.

A "climate of doubt" was a great piece that exposes the beginning of politics and climate change colliding and the disputes that arose because of it. While a bit infuriating to watch I must say the contents of the film were not all that surprising to me as it simply exposed once again the ugly side of politics. Politics can easily become a toxic playing field when economical and financial gain are mixed into potential policymaking. Climate change is no different, while there are some "scientists" that claim that climate change is an all-natural phenomenon and is not in any way influenced by humans, the majority that take this side do it out of economic reasoning. For the people who are higher-ups or part of corporate businesses, policy that would reduce the amount of fossil fuels used would cause a decrease in supply thus driving up resource costs and making users of fossil fuels have to pay a higher price, and with a lower amount of fossil fuels to supply, suppliers have fewer goods to sell and profit off of. All in all enforcing policy that would limit fossil fuel use in hopes of slowing down the effects of climate change is an economically terrible decision, leading some politicians and corporate owners to retaliate. However, they are not understanding the true weight of this problem as it is not simply one we can brush off in order to keep business booming and money flowing into pockets, this problem is a true threat to the entire world and some sacrifices such as financial loss need to be made for the greater good. For what good is political power and wealth when there isn't a world to use it on.

It is useless to say sorry if Myron Ebell realize that he and climate skeptics were wrong. We can prevent it from happening before making an apology, and the apology cannot afford the whole result. Millions of people would be suffered from the bad result just because some of them insist to be climate skeptics. Most people who deny the climate changing try to make more profit from destroying the environment, and they pay money to people for being "climate skeptics". People may choose to believe "2 doctors"  who pay the money to let you be their side, even if the left "98 doctors" insist what they believe, which is correct obviously. There is still some time left if we start to take actions now.

"Climate of Doubt" was frustrating to watch due to the comments climate change skeptics would say. It just sounded like a broken record, repeating the same comments that revolved around "the climate is always changing." However, if climate was truly always changing and going along its natural course then we would be due for another ice age but we are not. I think the most frustrating part of the film was seeing people, like Fred Singer, be confident that they have reputable sources and people backing them up. When the Oregon Petition was mentioned, its only requirement was to have a bachelor's degree in order to sign it. To me personally, the Oregon Petition isn't reliable because those people signing it aren't experts in the field of climate change. They can just be anyone with a bachelor's degree in whatever field they pursued. When actual climate experts consensually agree that climate change is mainly human caused, it should say something on the legitimacy of climate change. Another frustrating part of the film was seeing many people easily convinced that any environmental regulations on companies would hurt them economically. I understand that the public was going through a tough time, especially after the 2008 recession, but environmental regulations would not have had such a large negative impact. It would have "hurt" companies by forcing them to upgrade their technologies and reduce their emissions. Due to this switch in public opinion, politicians started to switch on their support for climate change. Instead of climate change being an issue of protecting the human race, it became a political issue of which party is right or wrong. Personally, I always wonder even if climate change was a hoax why would it be such a bad thing to move towards more greener and sustainable ways of protecting the planet? If anything we lose more from not doing anything. That's why when Mryon Ebell said that he would be sorry if he was wrong, it upset me because his "I'm sorry" won't fix the issue they continued to contribute to.

“Climate, to me, has become a non-issue. It’s a phantom issue. There is nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It’ll get colder, it’ll get warmer, we just have to wait a little.”

        <br><br>

Wow.
        <br><br>

That quote stemmed from Fred Singer, a veteran scientist who attended the Heartland Institute’s Annual Climate Conference in the film “Climate of Doubt”, where anthropogenic climate change deniers gather together and further strive to convince the audience that 97% of scientists’ consensus is a big hoax. I absolutely could not believe my eyes when I heard the numerous false claims this institute and their allies spew to hundreds of thousands of naïve people having to at least know, internally, that they are rejecting a strongly scientifically backed opinion on the state of our decaying earth. If we "wait a little", we will die. It's harsh, but it's true. 
        <br><br>

I find it deceptive simply how Singer relayed his message. He displays deliberate manipulation merely in the choice and order of his words. He utilizes the word “phantom” to describe climate change, and when discussing temperature, he cleverly mentions transitions to “colder” before “warmer”. By incorporating the word “phantom”, Singer is attempting to paint climate change as non-existent, almost foolish to believe in, like a ghost. Wikipedia defines phantom as, “An illusion, a distortion of the senses”. It is terrifying that Singer, in a position of authority and influence, can freely compare the crisis to an illusion.  It is clear that these deniers are blatantly manipulative, and people who rely on playing games with their syntax just to sway the listener’s opinion should not be trusted to instruct on the future of our safety.

I pretty much agree with all of this. I think Singer especially takes elements or fractions of climate change that once are isolated can actually be harmful to the crisis and since they're definitely factual within a series of facts, they are not absolute stand-alone truths. In fact, I believe the quote you open your comment with absolutely reflects what I am arguing. Yes, the Earth has phases of extinction periodically in which populations of beings are wiped out due to various reasons, including climate change. However, these mass extinctions still have elements of arbitrariness in them and are not always entirely "natural" in the sense that they are limited to the natural abilities of the Earth (e.g: an asteroid hitting the Earth creating clouds that prevent sunlight from hitting the Earth as arbitrary because it's outside of regular occurrences). Even if there is factual evidence that we may be in another period of a natural mass extinction, there is more than enough evidence that reflects our contributions to the amplification of this natural cause. For example, the amount of species that have already faced extinction because of man-made decisions like hunting etc. Singer takes a slither of truth to live in delusion.

This film takes on an entirely different approach to climate change as it mainly interviewed and focuses on those who assert climate changes do not happen. The filmmakers went to tea parties held by climate change deniers and listened to their reasoning. Their viewpoints were mostly not scientific and self-contradicted. As one man said it was crucial to win in politics and then science, which accidentally showed their real motivation: to take control of politics and block people’s recognition of science and science credibility. The drastic change between 2012 and 2016 really impressed me as the entirely different attitudes shown by Newt Gingrich. Although he videoed a environmental protection stream with Nancy Pelosi, four years later he referred to the experience as “I was stupid”.  The change is drastic, since in these four years, industries must have invested huge amounts of money into climate deniers. In fact, in my opinion, they are doing horror domination in the Congress. As former Republican Inglis was deprived of his Congress seat because of an acknowledgement of climate change, no one else in the COngress ever dared to express a definite idea on the climate change issue. The momentum of climate change politically is completely vanishing. I feel worried since the industry has power that much to stop an almost inevitable trend, it is likely that they will be still investing in climate change deniers in a more and more cautious way, and I cannot find a way out.

<p>
In the documentary "A Climate of Doubt, the audience is taken through the many opinions and claims climate change deniers have and are voicing to disorient the public. The film talks about how even their data is biased because they choose specific years to back up their ideas. Climate change scientist go over how every 10 years there is a slight decline in temperature but then the temperature rises even higher than it began. Climate change skeptics use these 10 year period as evidence for their claim that climate change is false. However when looking at the bigger picture, graphs showing more than the 10 year period demonstrate an obvious rise in temperature that climate change skeptics purposely leave out. 
         <br><br>

Additionally, a great point was brought up in the film that makes the current climate change crisis be viewed from a more clear perspective. Bob Ingils asks a skeptic that if his child is sick and 98 doctors tell him to do one thing and 2 tell him something else, what would he do. This statement makes the skeptic speechless and is a great analogy to what is happening. The earth is sick and if we dont act upon it the consequences will be worse. It is up to us to listen to the 97% of scientist and do all we can to change the situation or listen to the other 3% where it will soon be even to late to act.

I am upset about the fossil fuel industry that they made the worst decision. Instead of finding a balancing and sustainable solution to the crisis which they and we are all facing, fossil fuel industries are still wanting the most profit from the resources they control. I am also upset about myself for finding it understandable just as Ken said if I have 100 bucks in bank and only 12 of them can be allocated by myself, I would definitely fight against the bank. Same logic applies in fossil fuel. But the wealth gained by those companies are costing our future. That is why we shall stand up and tell others the truth rather than misleading information.

So what's annoying is that climate skeptics are always poking fun at global warming and even laughing when the issue is brought up. It's always just so reassuring to laugh it up with your fellow skeptics to make things less serious. A curious tactic. I mean, we don't laugh about gun control or the border dilemma. But we choose to laugh at global warming.
         <br><br>

When we actually started getting some evidence and head turns toward the topic of global warming is when the world got a whole lot more divided. Amid Obama's cap and trade pronouncement and the recession in 2008, it was easy to attribute the financial crisis to the rising global warming conversation. It was baffling to listen to these politicians trivialize climate change. It's almost as though they are going out of their way to make a joke of it. When Munkton says things like "CO2 is plant food" and "We should have the courage to do nothing," I seriously question humanity because one, this guy is representing the climate skeptic view and has no scientific qualifications whatsoever, never elaborates why it is not an issue besides some first grade CO2 explanation, and simply lacks momentum, a pattern that I noticed watching this video. 
         <br><br>

What was baffling was the diagram that exhibited the cooling of the Earth in the last decade in which a much greater timeline was manipulated to show one cooling trend instead of an upwards trend that is composed of rising cooling trends. It's called going down the up escalator. This manipulation of data is sad because the 2000's were, in fact, the warmest years we've had according to Actual experts. The audacity.

Why is it that Fred Singer is always denying denying denying and when the time comes to explain all I get is "oh these climate scientists are deluded, oh, The Oregon petition, ohhh." Please don't refer to that old global warming petition signed by non-climate specialists and a celebrity or two. It's all just a group of agreers. Don't be so shocked that climate scientists are doing their job and looking into the future. I meant to say "godless-treehugging liberals trying to suck out all of our money." Anyway, lawmakers should always be happy to answer a question. Especially a straightforward question. But when asked, though, climate skeptics are out of there, and fast too! Always scared to just answer a basic question. "Is climate change mainly caused by humans?" crickets And I'm referring to Fred Upton's refusal to talk too. At least provide some basic scientific precept. 
         <br><br>

One second Bill Cook is saying he only reads what makes sense and is "factual," but, like many climate skeptics, when he is asked a basic question, he answers with "We can't answer that," "What do we know about sea level rise?," "We don't know enough about climate change." How irritating, I thought you only listen to common sense Bill? I would like to see some more scientific approaches that this video possibly failed to provide so i can educate myself more on them and try to understand, but so far this video really made skeptics flop. 
         <br><br>

Many skeptics have brought up the "uncertainty" about climate change. We were doing well for a second on political intervention, but uncertainty and political interference got in the way again. I'm no expert but I can tell when someone doesn't have much to say because they are stubborn or simply ignorant. When you're uncertain about something, become certain about it instead of letting time tell because we've been uncertain for a while now.

The documentary “Climate of Doubt” has revealed how the issue of climate crisis has been influenced by politics. Some interest groups, especially the fossil fuel industries, are denying the climate crisis and trying to begin a debate of skepticism, which they have already done. I feel very sad when the documentary says that “a Virginia state legislator cut the words sea level rise from official request to study coastal communities” and “Tennessee passed a law allowing the views of climate change skeptics to be taught in schools,” which some politicians are using their power to deny the happening of climate crisis and trying to make kids in next generation be skeptical.

<p>
This movie/documentary is actually disappointing in many aspects. The reasonings behind not believing in the climate crisis do not make sense and are not supported by scientific research... climate is a SCIENCE problem, not a political problem nor a social problem yet. It should have to be scientifically proven right or wrong before people can debate on different political reasons to bash on the climate crisis. 
         <br><br>
People will constantly be in denial of the climate crisis not matter what, it is not our job to make them think otherwise but it is our job to do our best to better our own carbon footprint.

Watching a Climate of Doubt was overall a frustrating experience. A particularly frustrating moment was when North Carolina State Representative Bill Cook states that he “relies on whatever science makes good sense.” That is not how science works. You cannot just believe what makes you feel good, but what is presented through data and observations. He enjoys a book because it made better sense to him than other sources. How could someone as uneducated as him, who believes an excess of CO2 is a good thing for the beautiful trees and grass that are simultaneously being destroyed, be elected to represent people?
         <br><br>
Another part that stood out to me was Bob Inglis’s story. A heavily conservative politician was unseated simply because he believes science. Just by answering that he believes in human caused climate change was enough for his party to turn against him. It is strange to me that believing 97% of climate scientists is seen as a radical action, while ignoring all facts and data to fit in with a party full of deluded ideas is rewarded. It just does not feel right to see so many conservative politicians avoiding the climate crisis facing our planet. 
         <br><br>
It is clear many of the climate denying politicians may not truly believe what they espouse, as they are afraid to answer questions. The deceit and lying must weigh heavily on their conscience as they accept money from fossil fuel interests to destroy our planet.

This film just really confirms what this whole world is falling into. Exxon and Shell, etc. How all these companies doesn't give a damn about anything but themselves. Though they say they will give jobs but really those are temporarily unnecessary jobs created to exploit the earth and the human beings doing it. They always and will continue to always take everything for granted.

“A Climate of Doubt” was able to clearly depict how divided people are on the idea of anthropogenic climate change. It shows how manipulated a society can be, and serves as a frustrating reminder of how much control the wealthy and powerful have over the general public. The film illustrates the control that money has over politics, with specific examples of politicians suddenly changing their beliefs about the evidence of climate change, contradicting statements they had previously made on the matter. 

         <br><br>

The movie makes clear how money can have such control over people. Already wealthy individuals choose to deny their effects on the planet and manipulate others to agree, all to make even more money at the expense of our planet. It depicts how an individual can become blind to the destruction they are causing. I find it incredibly sad that people are able to justify the destruction they are causing, which will lead to generations of humans suffering, just for person monetary growth.

The Climate of Doubt is quite different from two previous documentary we have watched. Both The True Cost and Cowspiracy discussed about the serious environmental problems on our planet, but The Climate of Doubt shows us a totally different aspect of how people think about the climate problem. It raised a question that when the truth which scientists told us is blended with the politics and economics stand, should we still believe in the truth?
         <br><br>

In the documentary, some retired scientists and politicians suggested that the Earth is changing warm or cold with no relation to human beings. The climate science is a hoax. I agreed that the Earth is changing all the time whether human beings take the actions or not. But I think the change of the planet is not the reason for us to make no change, because we are still a part of the planet. We need to consider our future, and our later generations’ future. 
         <br><br>

Besides, it is kind of horrible that people are so easily incited in the documentary by the loquacious speaker. When the speaker coaxed the public that the climate science is a hoax, the public immediately followed him and shouted “The climate change is a bulls**t.” The problem is not dreadful. The most desperate thing is when the problem is just here, the politicians try to cover their eyes or deceive the public. Meanwhile, it is easy for them to give a “peaceful” but totally misleading impression, for example, “Going down the up escalator”. It seems like the global temperature is going down in every ten year, but the truth is that the whole trend is rising rapidly.
         <br><br>

To sum up, this is a good documentary for me because it gives me a different eyesight, an eyesight from a climate doubter to look upon today’s environmental problem, which makes me know that more people should get right education on the environmental problem instead of the misleading.

After watching the film "A Climate of Doubt and Merchants Of Doubt", I'm angry at what Myron Ebell replied. He replied that he would be sorry if he and all climate skeptics were wrong. That is totally irresponsible for millions of lives. When people finally realize that the climate change and global warming really exist, they will be too late to deal with it. It's a long-term process to recover the whole ecosystem. His apology won't be enough for those who will be suffered from the result of climate changing. What's more, he won't solve the problem left by him and climate skeptics. If we cannot do something now, we will lose our chance to save the world.

Merchant of Doubt was a very interesting viewing for me since it involved many comparisons that better helped me to  comprehend the different tactics used by skeptics and climate change deniers in the media and just how they deceive their audience into taking their words as undisputed facts. I found the comparison between what a magician does to fool his viewers and the methods employed by these people to be very creative comparison since both revolve around deception and different sleights of hand intended to manipulate what the viewer is actually seeing. I found it extremely unsurprising that a majority of these popular skeptics who were the face of the anti-climate change movement people were highly unqualified to have an opinion about the matter and were being payed to spout nonsense in the face of unsuspecting viewers, nitpicking and stretching data so much that wasn’t even true.
         <br><br>

 Hearing that a statistic was proven false, regarding 13,000 scientists supposedly against the idea of  human-driven climate change, yet was a recurrent fact brought up by anti climate change proponents really nailed the idea into my head that the other side is not concerned with facts or proving scientists wrong. It has never been a social or environmental issue for them but one that is purely a matter of economics as stated by one of the Koch brothers himself. If big businesses and corporations benefitted off of reversing climate change and moving towards cleaner forms of energy, there would be no question or effort going into denouncing the credibility of scientists and the clear cut data that exists. However, because policy changes regarding the reversal of climate change mean that large corporations lose money, of course they have made credible people a target to eliminate in their quest for greed and money. It’s truly sickening to see and makes me sad to think it’s people like this who have the most power and influence over the climate debate even though they are such a small number of people in comparison to reputable scientists.



</p><hr>


<p>
“A Climate of Doubt” is a prime example of how climate change deniers are trying everything in their power to convince the people that all this is a myth. They try to make arguments like saying global warming is a made up thing because the “earth is instead cooling down.” It is incredible how close minded these people are and it amazes me at how they do everything they can to protect their money. They want to protect their companies at all cost and try things like the ones shown in the film because of fear of losing all they have. Not everyone has the power to overcome the climate crisis, especially the poorer countries. What these big companies should be doing instead is using their great influence, power, and wealth to reach the common goal of slowing down the climate crisis. Enough of the corruption and exploitation of the environment, these companies need to accept our planet’s reality.

It was interesting seeing that the same institute, the Heartland Institute, responsible for many of the sources in this week's reading was also the ones responsible for climate change deniers conference called International Conference on Climate Change by the Heartland Institute. It’s important to note that this film was released in 2012, so keep that in mind when reading my comment because I’ll be mentioning things like “4 years ago,” which would not be 2016, but instead 2008 for instance. What’s more crazy than this conference existing is what the speakers at this conference have to say and the impact these types of conferences have on the American population. Speakers at this conference, such as Chistopher Monckton, argue that there hasn’t been any warming in the past 15 years. This is quite outrageous to state as a fact because we can clearly see with our own eyes proof from other films in class just how much impact warming has caused to the Earth and the people who live on it. Another infamous spokesperson was Fred Singer, a retired physicist. Keep in mind, this man was also the same man who in the past has claimed that humans weren’t depleting the ozone and that there wasn’t any correlation between secondhand smoke and health impacts. Fred Singer claimed that there hasn’t been a warming in the last 10 years and there’s no long term trend of warming. Again, don’t understand how someone could claim there’s isn’t any warming. Are they seeing the same graphs I am. Oh wait they must not, as this video pointed out. You see, it’s quite easy to create a false trend line, in fact, it’s so easy a person can do it in the comfort of their own home. For instance, people can show a warming trend that’s going down, which in the science world is called “going down the up escalator.” In other words, you can pick the end points and you could find any particular year as part of a cooling year, but in reality, the whole thing has been moving up. It absolutely baffles me that if I wanted to, I could make one of these trends myself, I wouldn’t need to go to any sort of lab or anything. As a result of conferences like these and people public stating their doubts in climate change, the number of Americans who agree global warming is man-made has dropped to about half in just 4 years. I would like to say I understand these people’s logic, but I honestly just can’t. I truly can’t fathom people who don’t believe that climate change is a thing or that it’s a danger. The climate change deniers have a leader who seems to be credible, Al Gore. So maybe for some it’s more in their trust for Al Gore than the statistics themselves that are making them believe that climate change is not real or a danger. Although, even if this is the case, I still don’t understand their beliefs on this issue. At this time, people promoting for change had yet to show they were engaged. Maybe this lack of engagement, shifted people’s mindsets towards the climate change deniers ideology. 
           <br><br>
  It doesn’t shock me that most Americans weren’t concerned with the climate change issue until the economy started going south in 2008. How could I be shocked? We live in a capitalist government, with people constantly driven by money and other materialistic items. Many people at this time were trying to push the idea that America couldn’t afford cap and trade tax. In fact, the citizens pushed it so much that it went from being one of the top priorities in the Senate to then being tabled in the Senate. People can be very persistent when they want or feel as if they need something. We saw this same concept occur in regards to emails as well. 1000 hacked emailed between scientists turned into Climategate and many used this event as a reason to doubt climate change. But the persistence of getting scientists’ emails didn’t stop there. For example, we had ATI requesting emails from scientists such as Kathrine Hayhoe and even asked Frontline, the program of this documentary, for their emails exchanged with the scientists in the film. It’s crazy to me that one of the skeptics main arguments is that “reducing emissions is cover for reducing freedom,” when many skeptics are trying to get emails from the scientists and invade their right to privacy that’s implied within the American Constitution. Again on limiting people’s freedom, we have a Virginia state legislator cutting the words “sea level rise” from an official request to study coastal communities. This isn’t something we can just ignore. We can’t all be like Upton, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, we can’t just delete the phrase “Climate Change is a problem” from a website and poof all of a sudden it isn’t. The amount of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean in 2012 was a record low, keeping in mind this video is from 2012. I may be wrong, but I bet last year, 2019, beat 2012 for the record. The truth of the matter is that people are unwilling to pay the price that’s required to protect future generations. When will we be willing to pay the price, or will future generations be forced to pay it for us?

The documentary, “A Climate of Doubt”, was easily the most frustrating documentary on climate change that I’ve seen so far. The reason as to why it was so frustrating is because of the following two reasons:1. climate change is being portrayed as a political issue rather than the fact that this planet will be destroyed if we don’t put an end to it, and 2. This documentary was made in 2012 and also referenced the 2008 elections and how climate change played a role in the presidential campaigning, and nearly 8 years later we are in the same, if not worse situation.
           <br><br>

 Climate change should not be seen as an issue that should be polarizing our country. In fact, it should bring this country together and drive us to want to make a change in our legislation and lead the rest of the world with our initiatives. The fossil fuel companies and climate change deniers are using climate change as a chance to polarize the country and take attention away from the harm it is doing to our planet, mainly so that they can make more money. At a point in the documentary author Steve Coll describes the big corporations’ agenda as such, he says, “Let's create doubt, create a sense of a balanced debate, and make sure that these lines of skepticism and dissent become routinely a part of public discussion about climate science." Unfortunately, by using this tactic, big corporations were able to turn the discussion on climate change into a debate.
           <br><br>

 Another thing that stood out to me about the documentary was when it was made, 2012. You could have made me watch this and said it was from 2019 and I probably would believe you, because how similar the situation is now compared to eight years ago. It’s sad how the country still seems so divided over an issue that is having visual impacts today. I believe the current elected president made this problem even worse by influencing his impressionable followers into blindly denying climate change. Using words like “free market” and “limited government” to shift Americans thinking into them believing that legislation on climate change will impose on their freedom. Watching this documentary almost made me feel like we are at a political standstill when it comes to this issue and that it will likely stay that way if we don’t take action now.

 I think it’s crazy that this documentary was produced in 2012 as well, seeing as we have not done much as a society to improve the situation that we’ve been living in for years. Similar to you, I have also emphasized that the climate crisis should not be viewed as a political and economic issue. As a collective society, there should not be any divide on whether the climate crisis is real or not. This divide has obviously gotten us nowhere, since we’re increasingly releasing carbon emissions into the atmosphere and adding fuel to the endless debate even now. Rather than debating, we should be coming up with solutions to mitigate this crisis. Additionally, it would be smart to start on a personal, smaller scale and move up to bigger corporations (if they were ever open to it). It’s so easy to say, and so much harder to do.

When watching Climate of Doubt I was astounded at the hearing of politicians and scientist which weren’t climate specialist at the ignorance in most of their responses towards climate change. It seemed as if they were being paid to not believe in climate change... oh wait they are. Huge oil corporations fund many of the anti-climate change parties in order to keep a fossil fuels from deteriorating in the market. 
           <br><br>
Many of then seem like they do believe but can’t say anything about them such thing because their tongues are being tied by oil companies well more or less being bought . This gladly seems a bit outdated since the boom in electric cars after 2012, I’m sure many would change their minds now that theirs another superior market in the game that will overtake fossil fuels in the coming years.

After watching the film I found a lot of very interesting, and stupid things.  For one, I believe it is very stupid how there are ongoing arguments about if climate change is real or not and if climate change is caused by humans or not.  I find this very dumb because of the fact the evidence is right in front of our eyes and yet there are multiple people who can not, or choose to not see it.  So they are in denial.  I find it astonishing that in four years Americans who believe global warming is man made has dropped to about half.  Global warming is caused by humans.  We are at fault, and people can not see it.  There are going to be grave consequences if we do not take action very soon.  I also find it amazing how 97% of active climate scientists agreed that climate change is due to human causes.  The people who are professionals in climate change are indeed stating that humans are at fault and we are the cause.  Virtually every place on Earth is heating up and this is because of the CO2 and greenhouse gases that we humans are releasing out.  We are the cause of this temperature rise throughout the world.  This is just so crazy to me, the fact that humans are the cause of the temperature rising.  The people who are denying climate change and claiming it is not real need to open their eyes.  They continue to promote things that continue to make the crisis worse and worse.  And they simply do not care about it.  It is very sad and depressing, slowly the world will feel the effects even more and will face the consequences.

<p>
While watching A Climate of Doubt, there were a few things that really made me think and stood out to me.

           <br><br>

First of all, It made me realize how silly that climate change is seen as an issue of the right versus the left; this issue is not one that only affects one type of person, we all live on the same planet and the effects of climate change will cause changes to everyone’s lives. I really appreciated that this documentary took points of views from different kinds of people, liberal and conservative people who were both for and against climate change. A lot of people’s political views are based off of what they think they are supposed to believe based on stereotypes and common beliefs. Seeing that there are also conservative people who advocate for (reversing) climate change can really help change the minds of some right minded people who think they have to be against believing in climate change just because they are conservative.

           <br><br>

However, there will still be the people that make the decision to disregard evidence and to reject scientific facts because that is what they want to believe. This documentary displayed how confirmation bias is a large part of the path that leads some people to believe wrong facts. The fact that the climate change skeptics wanted to analyze every part of the research and comments made from those who  advocate for the importance of climate change shows that they were just nitpicking and looking for the minor mistakes, instead of taking the big picture for what is was and accepting it as they did with the temperature trend lines. They took small parts out of the big picture and made it something it was not just to prove a point.
           <br><br>


In the end, whether someone believes whether climate change is significant or not, I have to say that I do not understand what the harm in just trying to reduce carbon emissions and making changes is. Bob Inglis stated a hypothetical about 98 doctors recommending a treatment, and that going with the 2 that say something else poses a risk. In the end, if there is a chance that those 2 doctors are correct, it would still pose less of a risk to go with the 98, and there would be no harm in doing so. It would be safer to just agree with the 98 and there would be no detriments. In the end, if climate change ends up being a “hoax,” it wouldn’t hurt in the future to reduce impacts now; however, if climate change is real and we haven’t done anything for the future, that is more detrimental.



</p><hr>


<p>
I agree with Bob Ingils when he said: "Your child is sick, you take him to the doctor, if 98 doctors tell you to do one thing, and two tell you to do the other, are you going to listen to the two?" It's crazy to me that 97% of scientists agree that anthropomorphic climate change is real, yet there are still so many people out there who doubt it. However, after learning that organizations and other businesses are putting money out to purposely confuse people, it makes more sense why there are doubters. I noticed that Ken and  the people within the video believe that there is a battle happening between those who believe in climate change and those who don't. Language and mindset are very powerful tools. For this reason, I prefer to not view it as a battle, but to instead view it as a difficult, but meaningful process of reconnecting people to the truth. Those like Myron Ebell are not bad people, they are just disconnected. For this reason, I don't believe that taking the approach of anger and saying things like the scientists who don't support climate change are horrible people is a good approach. These people are disconnected. However, through love, we can help reconnect them! We can be loving and compassionate and still get our point across!

I one hundred percent agree with your incentive about not hating the people, but rather pushing against the mindset. I'd be lying if I said I didn't sometimes wish these big corporations ill-harm, but is it true that many of these followers are just blind to the truth. People are misinformed and sometimes uneducated, which isn't entirely their own fault. I know I've believed lies when they're presented in such a pretty package, of making things seem so much simpler than they truly are. These big corporations have done such terrible things, but I do believe you're correct in the idea that alienating them is only going to make matters even worse.

This film talks about a controversial issue that whether global warming is caused by human activities. Personally, I believe human activity is the main reason for global warming, and some scientific results also show that. There are still some people who think the human is not the main reason why the climate is getting worse. Some of them are even scientists in this field. 
           <br><br>
The solutions to climate change will not actually work until people can really understand the problem of global warming. Fortunately, more and more people can understand how climate is changing and would like to learn more about the truth.



</p><hr>


<p>
As I was watching the film, I began to grow upset at all of those in support of the fossil fuel industry as well as the people who don’t believe global warming has anything to do with human causes. As Ken had explained, the sceptic’s goal is to confuse the public majority as to whether or not the warming is anthropogenically caused. We must find a way to get the vast majority of the United States public in agreement with the fact that humans are causing the Earth to heat more rapidly than ever expected. If this does not happen within the next year or so, I believe there will be dramatic consequences. These consequences will be even worse than those we are witnessing presently, such as the increased frequency of intensified storms along with some sea level rise in areas that are very vulnerable. Although it may seem simple enough to just show someone the sceptic’s tactics in showing a cooling trend, the big problem is revealing the shady work to the entire population. Anyone can look at previous temperatures and see that there is a warming trend throughout the last few decades. We just need to figure out a way to convey this information on a large scale, and present it as fact, as it is. At some point (and it needs to be soon) the fossil fuel companies and their supporters must accept that they are damaging the Earth greatly through use of their practices. 97% of scientists are in agreement that global warming is human caused, and that we will suffer the consequences in a short matter of time. I really liked the analogy Bob Ingles used when referring to the government taking a risk by believing the 3% of scientists who deny anthropogenic global warming is even a thing. He said something along the lines of, 97% of doctors suggest your kid should be treated this way, and you choose to listen to the other 3% of doctors suggesting another way… that is a big risk. If we all were to think of the Earth as our mother, which she is, I think we would listen to the 97% of the doctors in order to get her better.

The “Climate of Doubt” documentary demonstrates how climate change can be politicalized. It’s sad to see how the fossil fuels companies are being creedy, manipulates and deny the fact the 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is anthropogenic. The politicians waited for an opportunity that the economic crisis in 2008. They use that perfect time to convince that climate change is not real, this changes how people view climate change. People start having doubts about who to believe, and it has become a political issue.

It was interesting to me while watching the "Climate of Doubt" documentary that the people the most skeptical about climate changed happened to be the ones causing a significant portion of the issue, big oil companies that thrive off of the decimation of the Earth because of the revenue they are able to bring in. This documentary opened my eyes to the fact that there are really people out there using politics to dissuade people from helping and understanding a crisis in the hopes of trying to make more money. It is scary to think that in some places like Tennessee, it is allowed to teach climate change skeptics in schools. This blows my mind because not only is this a political move, it is a move that will destroy the hopes of getting the support of the coming generation when we need them the most. Finally, I have to say that Myron Ebell's comment when he said he would simply be "sorry" if their claims were wrong was shocking and unnerving. That was unbelievable and shows the true extent of care that he and the politicians/other people involved really have for the Earth.

In the United States, it's sad that the issue has become a political one. To its core, it really should be a humanitarian one, but its sad that oil industries thought otherwise. Now, thanks to fossil fuel companies, the issue of climate change is now political, and is misleadingly convincing the public that it is not real. Since the recent economy crash, industries needed to be lifted from economic stagnation, and oil companies saw the climate crisis as a huge threat.

This entire documentary was very intriguing. Diving into the counterargument of climate change, this documentary brings up several different events that outline the take off of this rise of climate change deniers. To begin A Climate of Doubt addressed the previously upward expansion of action against climate change. For a while it seemed as if there was going to be serious change and with everyone on board it seemed like nothing was wrong. CLimate change deniers, while silent, were apparently still mad and felt that all of this action and Obama's implementation of a cap and trades system was a front for Leftists to take America's freedom from them. However this seemed to change after the large scandal in which emails were leaked among scientists apparently showing discrepancies with the climate data. This was in turn met with a rise in climate change deniers as this would eventually come to be one of their biggest arguments in the debate regarding climate change. A politician, Bob Inglis was almost "made an example of" as he showed support for action against climate change while running for a Conservative office position. Even he said that he didn't think his words would carry such weight as he would eventually lose the running as all of his supporters would turn on him after learning of his position on the subject. When talking about the debate against man made climate change most of the representatives on the other side do not seem to know hat they are talking about honestly. One of the key spokesmen on the climate denier side has even said he has no scientific background. This really just showed me what I kind of always knew. Everything revolves around politics and money because at the end of the day there are people who choose not to look at the direct scientific findings done regarding climate change solely based on their political affiliation. And that thought does scare me.

He would feel "sorry". What a comforting sentiment to have when millions, if not billions, are struggling and dying. These people just don't care about a single thing other than their money. If they did they would open their eyes just a little bit to see the truth that they want so badly to not be real. Australia is burning down and it honestly feels as if not a single politician cares. The people who are funding the politicians are the lowest of low and the politicians who accept their money are no better and should be incarcerated immediately. They endanger the lives of the people they swear to protect everyday they make the decision to not act and even worse, the decision to spread misinformation to the populous. I understand people's concerns about switching out of a fossil fuel based economy because no one wants to lose money but its either lose money or die and the choice should be clear.

When watching the "Climate of Doubt", I was just completely fascinated by the complete turnaround in public option over the whole issue of human caused climate change. How an issue that seemingly had wide ranging public support and bipartisan support in government soon divided the country in the matter of an election cycle is insane. It truly goes to show how powerful the media and other outlets of the digital age are in swaying the opinions of Americans. Another thought that came to mind as I was watching the documentary was how ignorant climate change deniers are. When I say this, I don't mean this in a way that they are willingly trying to destroy the planet because I doubt that is a cause anyone is trying to support, but rather in a way that they are so uneducated that they actually think that what they are doing is good for Americans and good for the economy which is what they prioritize as #1. It is an extremely sad reality and very reminiscent of Orson Wells "1984" as the uneducated people are unknowingly brainwashed for the gain of the party elite, or in the case of the climate change, fossil fuel executives. It is apparent that these climate change deniers live in a world where "ignorance is bliss".

After having watched both "A Climate of Doubt" and "Merchants of Doubt" the seemingly unbelievable arguments against the existence of a changing climate start to make a little more sense. I should clarify - the arguments themselves are absolutely bogus but it's the support behind them that starts to make sense. Some people are just not willing to accept the lifestyle changes and even the guilt that comes with recognizing climate change, so these arguments and conventions offer a safe space for denial. It is extremely frustrating that organizations like the NIPCC exist and are successful at supporting the doubt that is a main driver of the worlds inaction regarding this crisis. One part that I did find slightly encouraging, however, is the portion that covered former congressman from South Carolina, Bob Inglis. He was willing to stand his ground and recognize anthropogenic climate change despite being a member of the GOP and knowing that he would most likely get voted out of his position. While he did end up losing his position, his views support the idea that climate change can and must be a bipartisan issue. Despite the disturbing portrayal of some of the beliefs of some Americans, I think that hope can be found outside of this film with the younger generation and climate activists like Greta Thunberg with the attention we are garnering towards the climate crisis.

It is common knowledge that there are climate deniers, professor Hiltner has talked about them before and I know that there is a large group of Americans who are climate deniers. Watching the film “Climate of Doubt” I was still left shocked seeing how close-minded people could be and angry knowing that some companies are creating this doubt and fear out of greed and competition because they want to beat the “left-sided” people in politics. I also felt sorry for the many climate scientists who were being harassed by companies just because they are informing the government as well as the American people about the facts of the climate crisis. When American politics is being shaped by money and fear that is when the American people be the most divided and on the issue of the climate crisis we have to be on the same page because the Earth will not discriminate against anyone of any color as well as it will not care if you are from the left tor right side of politics.  Something mentioned in the film that stuck with me is that many climate deniers and politicians who are paid by fossil fuel companies try as hard as possible to make sure there are no laws or regulations that have to do with the climate crisis but that doesn’t make the matter any less true or the consequences any less real which led to someone saying, “Those vulnerabilities don’t go away because you just legislature them away”. The climate crisis is something that not only affects the people in the United States but everyone around the world so we own it to poor countries who cannot afford to combat the consequences of the climate crisis.

<p>
I have never really thought much about how the climate crisis became a political issue in America but after seeing this documentary, I have seen how the government completely disregarded and canceled the idea that climate change is being caused by human activity and should be seen as a major issue. I couldn't stop thinking about why people changed their minds. Many scientists were paid by the government to make it seem like climate change is false news. This would lead to government funds being lost by major oil companies and much more. The politicians didn't want to have a different opinion compared to the rest of the world, so they forced themselves to agree that climate change isn't a major threat.
The people that did stick up for climate change like Bill Ingles, were quickly shut down by either
the government or non government people. Slowly but surely, the government was able to erase
climate change threats and make everyone forget about it, no one dared to challenge this issue.
Nowadays, we see many people speak up about the topic, but it leaves me wondering if maybe we
are too late. As a community, we need to realize that climate change is real and must take action
to keep future generations safe.

While watching “A Climate of Doubt” I found myself waiting for compelling evidence that supports the notion that Earth isn’t warming. Fred Singer claimed that science was “being hyped” in regards to climate change. His ideology that the 97% of scientists who believe in climate change are “deluded” is strange. I understand the need for skepticism but when the majority of the scientific community is sure on a large-scale pressing issue, there’s a problem. Spreading mass confusion to the public is what continues the spread of misinformation. It’s also unfair that climate scientists are put down and invalidated in their own fields. It is mind boggling to discredit someone who specializes in such a field. This film brought out more of the frustration I’ve been feeling towards the climate crisis. Upon hearing Steve Coll say that people think climate change is an issue for the unborn generations to come continued my feelings of bitterness in the idea that I worry people will come to their senses once it’s too late for the planet to recover.

<p>
I was aware of the fossil fuel industry’s intentions in propagating a climate of doubt, but to see the faces of all of these so called scientists and politicians was truly infuriating. I think it’s “easier” to blame a faceless corporation, but when you see that another human who lives on the earth is purposefully advancing its destruction is just truly disgusting. It’s frustrating to even see them smile, especially that vile excuse of a human Myron Ebell, that responded with “ I would be sorry” when asked what would happen if climate skeptics were wrong. Also Fred Singer, another useless scientist that has probably sold all of his credentials for a meager amount of money compared to the incalculable value of the earth. 
           <br><br>
I think Bob Ingils truly summarized this debate in a simple and unarguable manner. He said, “Your child is sick, you take him to the doctor, if 98 doctors tell you to do one thing, and two tell you to do the other, are you going to listen to the two?” The logical thing to do would be to listen to the 98 doctors if you want to save your child’s life. But of course it all boils down to power and money, can't have one without the other in this world unfortunately. Fossil fuel interests have slithered their way into congress and other powerful positions, buying representatives and senators left and right. I would even argue that politicians are the most bought product in the United States. 
           <br><br>
I’m not sure what to expect from this country when we finally come face to face with the climate crisis. I don't want to lose hope, I really don’t. But this whole country is being run by people with special interests that will fight tooth and nail to continue this climate of doubt. I just hope that there will be enough of us to fight just as hard if not harder to save our beautiful planet.

The climate of doubt is a very stunning documentary. The issue of global warming has become a political issue, and although it is costly, almost all political figures have to address this issue. But now the US public's views on this issue have cooled down. What is the reason behind this? This documentary interviewed many representatives of the climate denial movement and summed up the two strategies of the climate denial movement organization. The first strategy is to deny that climate change is caused by human factors, and the second is to exaggerate the uncertainty of the climate. Money is often the main force driving the development of one thing. In essence, any legislation on climate change issues may harm the interests of enterprises, then these companies will choose to take the initiative to buy money, rather than being forced to wait for bankruptcy. This reminds me of the slow progress of the US social ban on guns. Similarly, this bill will harm the interests of many traders and businesses, even though the ban on guns can guarantee people's safety. This has led many companies to infiltrate into politics through money, affecting the formulation of political decision. How to think deeply about the distribution of benefits is a gift from this documentary.

“A Climate of Doubt” was an incredibly eye opening news story about how the discourse on anthropogenic climate change became as polarized as it is today, and who were the major players behind it. This is a subject I’ve always found incredibly interesting, before 2010 climate change was a bipartisan issue, there are countless videos of conservative politicians, such as John McCain, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and more calling for action to reverse the devastating effects of climate change. The legitimacy of the science didn’t come into question until large corporations began feeling like their interests were being threatened.
           <br><br>


Additionally, I appreciated how informative the film “Merchants of Doubt” was in breaking down the tactics and strategies used by big oil and natural gas firm to put climatologists on the defensive. These are the same strategies used by big tobacco and other powerful companies that care more about profits than their products effects on consumers or the planet. Because they can’t produce evidence to contradict climate scientists and environmentalists, they instead attack the people behind the science. It’s quite alarming to see just how effective companies like PG and E and Exxon Mobile are at making academics and experts in climatology look less credible, while simultaneously putting forward their own “experts” who can plant the seeds of doubt on the topic on anthropogenic climate change. They have truly, within the last decade, altered the discourse on climate change in this country. What was once a near consensus has become a debate.

It seems crazy that the public and politics can garner their power behind something like taxing cigarretes and we can all recognize the exploits of big tobacco. Yet people cannot see that the same tactics are being used by the oil companies to keep us buying their products. To purposefully destroy this planet because of greed is horrible and I hope we all can get behind climate change like we could with cigarrettes

The documentary, “Merchants of Doubt,” explores how a small group of powerful people have had a large impact on what we understand today, and how they use their influence to shape propaganda we see in our everyday lives. It’s frustrating to watch – the film explores, for example, how the tobacco industry lied to the public and convinced everyone that smoking is safe and healthy, even though they knew it was not, and would even say that it doesn’t cause cancer. People used to smoke everywhere and it was entirely normalized. But then laws were put in place to protect people’s health, and for a while, it looked as though my generation was going to be the one that defeated smoking. But then Juul popped up, effectively sending an entirely new generation into the rabbithole of addiction. Our world is driven by profits, and it seems as though those in power do not care if they are hurting our bodies and our planet. Propaganda relies on the fact that science is difficult to understand, and it’s one of the most frustrating things to see throughout the film.

I agree completely about the propaganda being promoted with regards to climate change. I thought it was interesting how the tobacco industry manipulated the media to project that smoking was a great thing for the mind, body, and soul, when in fact it was detrimental to people's health. It caused for the death of millions of people due to lung cancer and various other side effects, but at the end of the day, tobacco companies kept pushing their product in order to make a quick buck off consumers. The movie "Merchants of Doubt" did a wonderful job exploring that topic, and exemplifying it through the use of a proper analogy. The film's emphasis on politicians turning a blind eye to scientific facts was so painful to watch, especially because it was very fully well known that the politicians only had their best interests at heart. It hurt to see such a corrupt group of people exist in one very powerful sphere, and knowing full well that climate change is having the same adverse effect on government is a sad sight to see.

After watching the documentary film “A Climate of Doubt” and Ken’s video, I am surprised the climate change problem is so much involved with the politics in the U.S. I come from China, and until I watch this film, I have never seen any Chinese politicians having any negative perspectives about protecting the environment. No matter what the reason is, at least they admit the main cause of the climate crisis is human activities, and they put efforts to solve the problems gradually. On the other hand, in the film, Myron Ebell says “I would be sorry” when he was asked about what if the climate skeptics were wrong. I have to say it’s far not enough to just apologize after everything happens. And at that time, it would be too late for him and other proponents to take the responsibilities of the wrong skeptics. 
           <br><br>
Another thing confuses me is that how so many people could really believe the skeptics. I mean, what they need to do is look at the surroundings and they will see we people are obviously the main cause. In other words, it seems like those people believe in the skeptics are the ones do not want to face the fact and choose to keep living in their own imaginations.



</p><hr>


<p>
The first thing I want to say is that, I was shocked by this film. For me, who totally awares of the climate change that's going on in our planet earth, I get confused when I watch this film. Because I think almost everyone knows about the climate change and most of them are doing something about it. Four years before this documentary was filmed, people all over the country was focusing on climate change and the actions about it. But in about 2012, some people started to question and even denied it. Some polititians like Bob Ignis even lost their support because of their positive attitude toward actions on climate change. I feel worried after watching this film. I worried if some people are going to deny the human-caused climate change again. I think the film effectively convey its point that we should not deny human-caused climate change with inaction anymore. Everyone, from normal citizens to senators to the Congress, should all do something about it and face this problem directly.

After watching "A Climate of Doubt" for the second time I again am disturbed by the views of climate skeptics and their true motivations. I think main proponents of climate skepticism are people who are afraid of more federal regulation and see climate change as a threat to capitalism and economic growth. Organizations such as the Heartland Institute, will continue to support people and organizations who continue to cast doubt on the topic and turn the climate crisis into a two-sided debate. These people have no factual evidence to support their opinions and at that no concern for future generations or the planet and are simply seeking the short term benefits of fossil fuels. 
            <br><br>

I have also seen "Merchants of Doubt" and have read the book and it is very apparent that it is a small group of anti-communist scientists, with connections to industry executives and politicians who continue to cast doubt on major issues in order to protect businesses from federal regulation. So while there is a 97% consensus on anthropogenic climate change, there are 3% of scientists who rather than giving factual evidence that it not real, seek to cause confusion within the public and thus stall federal regulations on the topic. 
            <br><br>

Both films do a good job of showing how these organizations, politicians, and a small handful of scientists continue to use the Tobacco Strategy to cause confusion within the public. It angers me though that this scientific consensus about major climate threats has turned into a political debate that will affect millions of people, species, and the planet.

The film, "A Climate of Doubt", showed the tactics organizations and politicians used to try to discredit climate change by underscoring the opposing side’s purposely misleading propaganda tactics and showing how they would take facts out of context to try to prove that the earth is not actually warming. After watching the film, I was shocked, frustrated, and disgusted over how certain groups and politicians tried their hardest to discredit anthropogenic climate change---especially when the clip showed climate “experts” who purposely misrepresented the effects of climate change in order to suit their donors’ interests. I learned a lot about how climate change gradually became a partisan issue in politics. Politicians began to see the carbon cap/tax as an “attack on freedom” and pushed their agenda so far that no one dares to discuss climate change anymore. Even President Obama backtracked on his stance on climate change after it became a divisive issue. I feel disheartened about the future of this planet because almost no one in authority seems to want to enact legislation to help curb the effects of climate change because it would hurt their pockets.

Last year I read the book, Merchants of Doubt, and now after watching A Climate of Doubt, I honestly believe that politicians could convince people of anything at this point. All these climate skeptics do is deny science, which is facts, and comeback with their opinions backed up by no evidence. I'm also realizing how little the government seems to get done with big issues like climate change, because our two party systems is completely polarizing. If a climate skeptic who is likely a conservative extremist claims that a far left politician wants reform for climate change, which is supported by real science and agreement of 97% of scientists, then they are seen as left extremist, so no one will support them. I think there is a big difference between having different values on economic and social issues than someone else, but it's another to blindly follow your 'party' just out of being stubborn. Climate change is not a debate, because there are no two sides. It's science and it's not something you believe in like if you believe in not using contraceptives because you're catholic or you believe that women have the right to make the choices for their own bodies. What many of the skeptics at these rallies and conferences claim s their 'side' is that climate change shouldn't be blamed on humans it's just part of nature and that it's not doing actual harm either. How can American people not see the patterns of extreme weathers that are happening right now and have been for years? Do they no watch the news? Do they not believe it once their house floods or their town burns down? I'm guessing a majority of them are not very well educated because I don't think they understand the difference between weather which is short term and climate which is long term atmospheric activity. I'm a little surprised how they also can't see a profit from the climate crisis. Anything can be made into a billion dollar industry...isn't that the American way nowadays? I'm sickened by the thought of how many people have been brainwashed by people like Ebell and Singer, who aren't even practicing scientists let alone climate scientists. Even if us as Americans want to close our borders and build our economy why can't we be selfish and save ourselves and our families from fires in California, hurricanes in Florida, and flooding in the south. There are disasters happening that hurt us everyday, so if we don't care about the billions of other animals and humans and the entire planet's environment why still can't we change?

Smoking is harmful to health, the Star Wars plan simply cannot effectively prevent nuclear war, acid rain is harmful to all mankind, ozone holes are harmful to all mankind, and the planet is warming due to increased carbon emissions. However, in the history of the United States, some scientists have either deliberately disseminated incomplete, unprofessional, unprofessional Represent the views of the mainstream opinion of the scientific community, and try to disguise as comprehensive, professional, and mainstream opinions. The public and the media have repeatedly been fooled. History has proven that they are wrong, and that they did not erroneously because of technical reasons, but subjectively deliberately distorted the facts for interests or political purposes. Let professional people do professional things, have doubts about things but pay attention to them, and do n’t become agnostics. The circle of science is the representative of human science. We can trust them, but scientists also have research fields. Expertise. For the physical content, we believe in the circle of physical scientists, and we leave mathematics problems to mathematicians for solution. Maintain rational skepticism and carefully choose who you trust. The world will get better and better, at least we should work for it.

This week’s film “Climate Doubt” was an interesting one. This film is different from what we have seen so far in terms of content and desired goals. “Climate Doubt” does a great job at exposing the skeptic side of the climate change debate. Those who believe that climate change is a product of government lies to gain more money by scaring people. Deniers of climate change have gone too far to discredit renowned scientists about their work in order to fulfill their ego.
            <br><br>
 What I liked about this short film is that it shows us the way deniers of climate change think and how they act. Usually, we see those who are pro climate change on the big screen and not those who deny it. It is interesting to see how they think, act, and perform their duty. Throughout the film, I was somehow upset at the way these people would act because it just seemed like a joke. I feel like they just do this to divert people from the truth that fossil fuel industry finances all these groups to spread their word across the nation. One thing that really triggered me was when they mentioned climate- gate which basically describes in a series of emails that scientists were trying to lie to the general public about climate change, and that everything was a hoax. This is why I get frustrated with this kind of people. Their logic seems to me as the one of 5-year-old. We can see the dangers climate change has done to our planet; we have seen the changes in weather and seasonal cycles; the loss of life, and yet they make us believe scientists are lying to us? This only show how desperate they are to be heard. Maybe a few years ago, we would have believed that climate change did not exist, but now it can be seen from almost everywhere around the globe.
            <br><br>
 During the film, there was another instance where I just laughed and had to stop the video. This part was about a woman telling the audience that carbon dioxide is life and that we need it as well as plants, trees, etc. They think because plants use carbon dioxide to produce sugars that now climate change is justifiable. I agree that carbon dioxide is essential for plants for the synthesis of sugars and the production of atmospheric O2. However, the way we are using carbon dioxide is uncontrollable. We produce more than we need to. This is like a carbon dioxide addiction. Once we started using it, we have progressively increased its production around the globe. Our addiction of CO2 is what’s causing the damage to our earth. So, while CO2 helps produce O2, its excess generates atmospheric pollution. Climate change is a threat to our national security. It is not a threat to our economy nor environment but to everyone on earth. I do not believe that scientists fake all these data to make us believe about something that does not exist. What would they gain?
            <br><br>
 These deniers have planted the seed of deception amongst the American people and have made their way to the core of our government. Little by little, they have accomplished to reduce the number of people who believes in climate change. By doing so, they are harming the earth more than we are with the emissions of CO2. People who become ignorant to this cause will contaminate even more than now because they would believe that everything is a hoax and there’d be nothing to worry about. If we get to that point in society, our earth will be lost, and it will be too late to do anything about it.

I agree with you when you say maybe a few years ago, we would have believed that climate change did not exist, in fact, I think that the combination between the heartland reading we did this week and the documentary could've made me doubt my beliefs about the climate crisis as a whole. However, after taking this class with Ken; watching, reading and absorbing all the information, I like you find the climate deniers not only horrifically wrong and unjust but see them as true cowards. But the main thing that I fear from these climate deniers and movies like "A Climate of Doubt" is not the effect it will have on the climate activists, but the effect that it will have on those on the fence. The people that know they should change the way they live but are too lazy and thus look for any excuse out of it. These types of Climate deniers are exactly the excuse that complacent people need and are looking for in order to not carry out their duties as a citizen of this planet. I say this because I could see myself as one of those people, I would feel so guilty about not living a sustainable life, and continuing to buy things like new clothes and single-use-plastics, but then I'd hear one thing about how "There is nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It’ll get colder, it’ll get warmer, we just have to wait a little.” and how this is simply the cyclical nature of the earth , we went through an ice age and this is just like that! Right! RIGHT? And therefore, that gave me the perfect excuse not to care and not to do my part. 
            <br><br>

Another thing I found interesting was how despite 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real, and mostly human-caused, this documentary shows how some individuals and groups have the audacity to try and continually frame politicians and scientists who believe in climate change as alarmists or conspirators who manipulate data. They say the science "isn't settled," and that the consensus on global warming is not a scientific consensus, but a political one. What I find so interesting about this is that usually, we hear about the corrupt nature of the Fossil Fuel industry and how they manipulate politicians and pay them to disparage the climate crisis publically; however, in this documentary, they are almost trying to do the same to the climate change supporters (tarnish their credibility and stances). In my opinion, the reality is that the climate change deniers are the ones that are playing a completely political and profit-hungry game, they are almost trying to lift the blame from themselves and put it on someone/ anyone else!

It is a scary thought to think that scientists are sending emails fabricating the consequences of climate change and even fabricating the concept of climate change as a whole. How do they live with themselves trying to brainwash people? I cannot imagine having the courage to fund money for research to try to prove climate change wrong despite the scary evidence. "When I think of our earth, I think of what Gd has created." This stood out to me because I am a very religious and spiritual person. I whole heartedly agree with this woman's statement. We are not only disrespecting our unforgiving earth when we contribute to climate change or the denial of climate change,  but we are also disrespecting Gd. I think it is a great thing to use taxpayer's money for activism towards climate change. If we cannot get people involved in trying to reverse the damage we've already caused to our earth, then we need to start using their money to get them interested in what their money is going towards.

The film “A Climate of Doubt” starts off with the sense that it will present some hard evidence against climate change from the older scientist who worked with weather satellites. But as the film progressed, it appeared that there was almost some sort of sinister undertaking towards the climate scientists. These scientists were being asked to share their emails and information about their findings about climate change. This is mostly due in part because of the “Climate Gate” that happened where scientists were supposedly changing their statistics and numbers. The people asking for their emails and research almost seemed to be deliberately looking for forged numbers or misinformation so that they can disprove and even discredit the climate scientists. I like to view myself as a more logical and scientific person when it comes to learning and viewing information, especially when it is scientific information. When I found out that these people were deliberately trying to discredit these scientists and their work, I was outraged. This is their life's work and other people are trying to come in and question their integrity. These people do not deserve that kind of treatment and the people that tried to look down and discredit their work should be ashamed of themselves.

After watching the film, “A Climate of Doubt”, the challenges and consequences with the climate “debate” became clear to me. When we have constant input of doubt into our political system, there will be no successful avenue for politicians or citizens to pass climate legislation. As shown by the situation with legislation regarding coastal homes in North Carolina, the climate crisis has become a winning or losing argument. But as said by one of the commentators, the ocean will win, not the right or the left political groups. No matter how much debate we have, climate change is occurring now, and only accelerating every day. Further inaction or climate deniers “winning” will not cause sea level rise to stop occurring. This also connects to the denial of agreement among scientists about climate change. From the conversation with Republican representative James Sensenbrenner, we see that even the admittance of climate change is insignificant when the consensus among scientists is denied. When asked “If 97% consensus doesn’t prove it to you, what will?, he served no respectable answer. This baffled me. Even if nothing in the world is 100% certain, we have to follow what we know. Climate change is no longer a theory, but sound truth that we can see in the world around us.
            <br><br>


The closing of the movie was particularly notable. Bob Ingils analogy of a sick child is another step towards giving the climate crisis a face. And this analogy isn’t only a metaphor but the truth. The planet we are handing down to our future generations is sick, and we are making our children sick by giving it to them. We are handing down chaos to those who have had no role in creating it and may have no possibility of solving it. Every little bit of inaction we take today is causing waves of destruction in the future.

I understand the point you make when you said that having a constant input of doubt into our political system prevents politicians and citizens to pass climate legislation; however, I don't think it totally prevents it. Passing nationwide policies in favor of fighting climate change is a distant goal, but I think if local governments begin to put eco-friendly laws into place that prove economically and environmentally beneficial, a domino effect will occur. Every journey begins with one small step and I think the process of combatting climate change from a governmental standpoint is no exception.

I think advertising the climate crisis similar to Bob Inglis's metaphor would be an effective way to make changes amongst the American people if done so on a wide scale. Although I don't believe utilizing fear is the most moral way to make people do something, it often is very effective. Additionally, symbolizing the climate crisis as a generational sickness induces emotional thoughts in people regarding the health of their young and future relatives. Since many older people think about climate change as an issue that can be dealt with after their lifetimes, making this generation feel responsible for their children and grandchildren's futures will cause them to rethink their choices and lifestyles.

After watching both “A Climate of Doubt” and Ken’s lecture on the film, I was surprised to learn about the manipulation of public knowledge regarding climate change. It is so unfortunate to think that many people will not be exposed to the fact that information denying or posing skepticism against the science behind climate change has been published by conservative think tanks which are funded by the fossil fuels industry as mentioned in Ken’s previous video, “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”. The term “anthropogenic” came up within this lecture in regards to the human activities that have had such a negative impact on our planet. The word anthropogenic surfaced in another of my classes here at UCSB and the professor of the class asked us when we had first come across the word. This was a difficult question for some people to answer as many members of the class were introduced to the term through participating in this very class. I am not saying that this is by any means a bad thing, but I found it interesting that we as humans in the 21st century are very aware of the climate crisis, but still have not accepted the fact that we are the ones causing the crisis—often times not placing the word “anthropogenic” before climate change.

“A Climate of Doubt” did an excellent job of showing on how the climate change issue has been politicized. After watching the film it was astounding to me that so many people with such influence in our government still deny evidence that clearly points towards anthropogenic climate change is real and happening. The evidence they are denying has been gathered by scientists from more than 30 countries. It’s so ridiculous how people can put politics in front of the well being of the earth and all life on it. Republican congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, had 100 percent republican support until he answered a media question on whether he believed in anthropogenic climate change. Once he answered yes to the question, his conservative supporters and conservative media bombarded him in the media. This global issue has become politicized and has turned Democrats and Republicans against each other. This is because republicans believe that the Democrats are trying to push their liberal agenda upon the country. Their argument is that they want to use climate change as a force to create more regulations and taxes which is not what they are trying to do. The data gathered over the years is clearly showing that the earth has been getting hotter and hotter over the decades. I believe people should watch this video to finally get them to realize that politicizing this issue will not allow us to help the climate crisis. Turning this issue into one that is a party against a party is counterintuitive and will only cause further complications in the future. What I have taken away from this video is that until people begin to accept the evidence that is not fabricated in any way, we will never be able to make progress on the global climate crisis

It really is crazy how so many politicians can deny hard evidence of global warming for the sake of their own greed.  They are harming the world for years to come just to earn some more money or votes.  One part that angered me in the documentary was when the skeptics showed a small time period of data which appeared to show that the Earth was cooling.  They did not show the long term data, which showed a continuous increase in global temperature.  These underhanded methods mislead the public and control politics.  I agree that this should not be a party vs party issue, as I believe that this issue is a matter of humanity vs global warming.

While watching the documentary climate of doubt, all I could think was that people are so caught up on their own current lives that they forget to look at the big picture. We are all on this earth and we share it’s resources, no matter if we are republicans or democrats we are going to suffer the same consequences of climate change. People seem to associate the climate crisis as a political issue, but it’s not it is a global issue. The policies we make in this country and the manner in which we live our lives not only impacts us but every single human being on the planet. 
            <br><br>
As we have talked about at great lengths this week, 97% of scientists agree that climate change is not only real but mainly driven by human actions. There is no longer a debate to whether climate change is real or not, the debate now should be what actions are we going to take to halt the release of greenhouse gases before we change our planet’s climate so drastically and so fast that we kill virtually every living being we share it with. 
            <br><br>

I can understand why people are reluctant to impose a carbon tax and stop using cars because it changes their lives and requires sacrifice. What I don’t understand is why people cannot see the incredible impacts switching to renewable energy would bring. Not only would it decrease dramatically the amount of greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere, but it would also create new jobs and once ways of collecting the energy are put in place such as wind turbines or solar panels, the source would be unlimited. We would no longer have to worry about depleting our planet’s resources or spending billions of dollars finding new and more polluting ways to extract that energy. The Trump administration has stated that the US cannot spend so much money on renewable energy because coal and gas are so much cheaper, yet cities like New York and Florida are already spending billions to protect themselves from the rise of sea levels, which could be prevented in the first place.

My initial impression of this documentary left me feeling disturbed. I do not understand how so many older, educated people could all collectively call climate change a hoax when there has been thousands of studies by actual scientists that clearly show how real it is. I find it hilarious how people like Christopher Monkton can state such bold claims with no type of scientific background, but I do find it disturbing how he has so many followers that believe what he says. It is insane to me that people can call climate change “a fallacy,” when we can literally see the effects of it in today’s world events. Melting ice caps, higher sea levels, increasing temperature, all of these which are the effects of climate change. 
            <br><br>

I also find it atrocious that most of these non believers will manipulate actual scientific studies to fit their agenda. They will look at trends and only use a little piece of it to fit their context when in actuality they’re just “going down the up escalator.” It shocks me how so many people in politics flat out disregard the existence of climate change. It shocks me even more how 97% of scientists agree that climate change exists and ongoing, but there are still people who do not believe in climate change. It’s shameful that a lot of these advocacy groups are led by economists, litigators, and lawyers, all people who are good at convincing people of things. After watching this documentary, I feel a sense of disappointment towards all these political figures and agencies who obviously only care about money and not the wellbeing of our planet.

Whats new? Conservatives continue to cripple our country as well as the well being of the planet. All for financial gain. It’s almost as if nothing matters to them but their wallets. This film was very hard to watch as they debunked hard working scientists and their work all because they feel that acting on climate change would hurt big corporations and consequently hurt their financial gain. The most outraging part of the film for myself was showing how they skew the data by picking certain endpoints. How people by the garbage that these conservative groups put out is beyond me. 
            <br><br>

 The fact is is that this is not a political issue it is an issue of life or death. Yet we have people that rather make this an issue if politics. The fact that anthropogenic climate change is even being debated is beyond me. How people can actually build arguments and then proceed to argue 97% of scientists is beyond me. We as the people need to wake and stop giving any power to these people that are only driven by greed and work to save our planet before it is too late.

After viewing the film, "A Climate of Doubt", I was honestly more convinced that climate change is not a hoax. There was no presentation of concrete evidence supporting the claim that climate change is not real. Instead the film comprised of explanations that scientists are supplying fabricated studies and a lack of responses from those who hold seats of power which may "signal" that climate change is not worth a discussion because it isn't real. I felt that if there were any conspiring done, it was carried out by fossil fuel interests as they try to confuse the public with public service announcements and advertisements similar to tobacco companies. I feel as though these actions are the ones that should be discussed further as science is greatly indisputable due to its objective nature. Fossil fuel interests understand the respectability of science which is why they are trying to attack scientists and there credibility. They realize the threat that science can pose to their profits which is why they are trying their best to dissipate their opposition's support. The film was very frustrating to watch as I strongly feel that the recognition of climate change is long overdue and has been greatly delayed due to our society's denial of our choices as consumers and inhabitants of a shared planet. I feel that our planet's and future generations' livelihood is at stake if we do not take responsibility for the destruction we have caused and profit is no longer the entity that holds power and priority in our society.

After watching the film “Climate of Doubt”, I was very disappointed by some politicians like Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, who want to join Democrats in saying that climate change was a serious issue and needed to be awarded, have now changed their attitude by saying that the science on climate change is inconclusive. Although most climate scientists have agreed on climate change is real and is caused by human activities, groups like the Heartland Institute and the Americans for Prosperity have not only attack climate science and cause doubt but continually framed politicians and scientists who believe in climate change as alarmists. This movie did a good job of exposing the tactics climate deniers have used to convince the public that climate change does not exist. The reason is that many businesses will be hurt by these climate change legislation, especially fossil fuel businesses. Therefore, they paid as much money as they could to these institutes to make people doubt climate change’s reliability. The most common strategy they use is fooling the public with fake experts. For example, the Oregon Petition is that anyone with a Bachelor of Science degree or higher can sign it. 31,000 signature signed to disapprove the climate change sounds like a larger number, but it is just a fraction of one percent of the total number of all Americans who have a Bachelor of Science degree, and some of the 31,000 people even don’t have any knowledge about climate change. In my opinion, these companies should use the money they spent on fooling the public to improve their technology to reduce the CO2 emission. On the other hand, we need to let as much as possible Americans be aware of the scientific consensus on climate change, so they will not be fooled by these denialists easily.

After watching "A Climate of Doubt", I was amazed about how little Ebell cared for our world and the current situation. To just say sorry if he were to be wrong is horrible. There is so many signs of climate change going on around in this world and just to turn a blind eye to it is amazing. So many people are affected daily by the choices of bigger corporations that it amazes me that more is not being done. While yes, there is a record of our planet going through cyclic changes in its atmospheric concentrations and relative temperatures, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has never been this high, and for people just say wait a little bit is ridiculous. To wait a little bit could take thousands of years for the concentrations to lower if we aren't putting any more into the atmosphere.

Throughout the film "A Climate of Doubt" I was struck by the success that politicians and lobbyists who doubt the science regarding anthropogenic climate change have had to influence the opinions of the American people. The fact that such a minority viewpoint in the scientific community is shared by such a large amount of people is a testament to how disinformation can penetrate the minds of misinformed people. Unfortunately, due to the power of money in shaping narratives and swinging elections, climate action can be stymied by a small number of people who would take a financial hit as a result of the implementation of comprehensive environmental legislation. 
            <br><br>
In the film, it appeared to me that the most successful lines of attack from the climate skeptics in changing people's opinions is to introduce doubt. Fossil fuel companies and the politicians and media entities they fund only have to make people slightly question or lose faith in the scientific facts to achieve their goal of preventing people from supporting legislation, such as a carbon tax or cap and trade. I think the reason this is successful is because voters are generally pretty scared to embrace change and take risks. In times of economic prosperity such as now, it is understandable that people are tentative to support policies, such as the Green New Deal, that vow to completely restructure the U.S. economy that is already providing record low unemployment and continued growth. Then, climate skeptics, like those profiled in this film, make people doubt the word of scientists. This makes people even less likely to support policy as it makes it easy for them to dismiss proposals that would have a considerable impact on their lives. Most of the arguments used by the climate skeptics, like saying there isn't consensus about climate science or that climate activism and policy is simply a way to achieve liberal policy goals, aren't complex or comprehensive, but they do make people question the science enough to prevent action.

After the movie and video I thought it was crazy that some people absolutely think climate change is not caused by people.  Ken said that the politicians either are for climate change and try to reduce it and other just ignore it and I think they know of climate change and that humans cause some of it but they choose to just ignore it because they think they have other ideas worth the time to fix.  
            <br><br>

Also, mentioned by ken the politicians will acknowledge the climate crisis as along with the fossil fuel companies.  However, it will be too late because the anthropogenic impacts will be too severe and already today getting severe.  I thought is was sad and irritating about the whole “I’m sorry” because all these families will be at a lost of houses, cars, money, food etc because of disasters caused by climate change and all he has to say is sorry.  He could prevent this before it happens.  The climate change will affect his friends and family too.  This just emphasizes how it seems that politicians lack interest in saving the planet and just assume the planet is going to die and that we humans all die some day so they don’t care.  I guess we just have to deal with it like politicians expect us too and the only way to get us out of the hole is if we ourselves put down the shovel.

The documentary “Climate of Doubt” will make anyone want to pull their hair out. The stance these skeptics take and their evidence (if any) behind it is very hard and irritating to listen to. This documentary gave skeptics a platform to try and convince Americans that climate change is a “hoax.” However, after carfare analysis of the evidence these scientists provide, it is clear that it is all manipulated and twisted. For example, as climate scientists Gavin Schmidt explained, one can find a cooling trend in temperature change every 10 years. However, on a larger scale, these small cooling trends are actually apart of an increasing overall temperature change, or as scientists call it, “going down the up escalator.” Climate change skeptics, most of which are funded by fossil fuel companies,  will only provide a fraction of the overall factual evidence in order to keep their companies running. The answers these skeptics provided to rhetorical questions were so silly and shameless, it was unbelievable and hard to watch. The new generation has been doing an amazing effort on slowing down the effects of climate change, but ignorant skeptics- such as those seen on this documentary- are unfortunately also “inspiring a new generation of skeptics.” It is very important for everyone to stay informed and open minded to what the cold hard evidence presents, and not what a small percentage (3%) of scientists want you to believe.

After watching the film from this week, “A Climate of Doubt” provided a wider perspective regarding the issue of Climate change. I am completely disappointed by our political leaders and how they tackle climate change. Indeed, most of the sources that I have read academically or even during my spare time exploring the  issue of climate change, I could agree to most of the politician’s approach that having 97% of so-call scientists approval in claims that the planet is heating could be misleading to society. Moreover, I am able to comprehend and understand the “other side” political view, I understood  that no one could possibly have the right answers or the right decision to whether climate change is actually happening or not. However, I don’t think it is safe to just simply abandon the issue because of the lack of proven data or justification. Similarly, just like most of the comments here, I feel disgusted by Myron Ebell’s response of “ I am sorry” when asked about  the skepticism regarding the validity of climate change. Personally, If I was the one interviewing Ebell, I would also say “I am sorry” to him because his naivete among with many others, will lead his close friends and family, and of course, humanity into deep danger when calamity strikes. In the light of funding, I have deep uncertainties regarding the fund support, the so-called “DonateTrust”. The film did an excellent job in exploring that topic. Most of these politicians have backgrounds or sketchy connections in which they will go around the system and completely hide their own identities, all for the sake of their own capitalistic greed. I find it crazy that most of these politicians will literally do anything for their capitalistic greed to expand rather than save their own kind.

“A Climate of Doubt” alludes to the issue of climate change as political in addition to scientific. It didn’t feel like climate change deniers presented any real evidence that climate change wasn’t real, they mostly focused on “proving” the current ideas wrong. Which adds to the confusion and doesn’t add value anywhere. When politicians push for their own agenda with climate change, the Earth becomes an expensive casualty. It is incredibly irresponsible for any one person/corporation to put their personal wants ahead of those of the planets. This film was just extremely frustrating to watch but I have faith that we can overcome this.

Like you, I too was incredibly frustrated while watching the documentary. For me, it was  frustrating to see that at one point, there was a consensus that climate change was real, however, after the recession of 2008, the people's fear of losing job allowed skeptics to play with that fear and push their own agenda against climate change.
            <br><br>

The evidence that climate change skeptics provided actually frustrated me because of how cherry picked it was. Fred Singer provided evidence on how climate change was not real by looking at the downward temperature trends that spanned ten years, however when you look at the bigger picture, you can see that the general temperature trend was that the temperature is rising. Fred Singer chose presented data that matched his view, but disregarded the bigger evidence that disproved his claim.
            <br><br>

The issue of Climate Change has turned from a scientific issue into a political issue. Politicians push their own agenda against climate change while turning a blind eye on the visible effects of climate change and warnings of climate change scientists. I wish we could go back to before 2008, when climate change was taken more seriously than now.

“Merchants of doubt” should be a mandatory watch for all climate change deniers. It proves beyond reasonable doubt that climate change is only actively growing because it is politically interesting for it to be. Politicians’ number one concern are to line their pockets while in office; their jobs are temporary, as are their lives, and since climate change won’t affect them personally, what does it matter? They just follow the lead of lobbyists who promise them money and jeopardize the livelihoods of millions of people.

I can't help but feel the exact same way. With all of the prior examples with the exact same things happening with big corporations and other bad effects on humans, you think people would learn, but climate change deniers don't even seem to realize that it's a similar situation. Or, even worse, they don't even realize it's happened in the past! They just assume that everything we know now in terms of public safety was just immediately accepted because it was true, even though that was very clearly not what actually happened. If more people saw this, they would hopefully at least make the connection that sometimes doubt is created by large companies to preserve themselves. 
            <br><br>
What's also funny to me is that what is being said by these large companies is actually the exact opposite of what is happening. Deniers say that climate change is all a ploy by the government to make more money, when really the doubt they have is a ploy by these big organizations to do just that.
<br><hr>
I think it's kinda sad that so many people strive to be of top earning status as a life goal. These people with money and power are driven out of selfishness to get what they want in dishonest ways. Lobbyists paying off politicians to protect their industries with certain laws is a pretty slimy, dishonest move. They have so much money they can basically pay to make our country's laws; they can sway politicians to protect certain policies, fight for new policies, and try to remove current ones. Not only in "Merchants of Doubt" did I learn about this strange cahoots the government is in with fossil fuel companies, but it is also a topic a 2020 democratic candidate openly talks about and wants to stop. Bernie Sanders made the point that politicians are spineless. They'll take what is basically a bribe to support something, even if they really may not be in favor. In other words, our government is owned by a few big name companies and organizations. Electing a new president and removing Donald Trump from office is not enough, the entirety of American politicians Washington D.C. need to grow some kind of backbone; the act of accepting money to support a new bill etc. should be frowned upon in our government.

Viewing “Merchant of Doubt” was exploring such an interesting aspect of the climate crisis, to investigate the reasoning behind anti-climate change conspiracy theories. It is extremely upsetting to learn that people, people of power even, intentionally manipulate public knowledge of the anthropogenic climate crisis solely to benefit themselves. “Merchant of Doubt” was such an educating and stimulating watch, and it further helped me understand how the arguments for or against anthropogenic climate change argument has been shaped by politics and political-based views.



            <br><br>

Both “Climate of Doubt” and “Merchant of Doubt” have made me think: with all the money at risk, I find it odd that there is so much proof that validates anthropogenic driven climate change--however, fossil fuel companies have yet to change their ways in anticipation of the future reality of this crisis. Instead, we have people like Myron Ebell’s simply stating that “I would be sorry.”  This lack of empathy and ignorance is just a few of many who are pushing our planet back, extending serious issues that could otherwise be drastically improved by making the changes that climate activists are supporting. It is clear that we must convert to renewable energy, and not at the cost of "being sorry" but at the cost of making our Earth habitable again.

I completely agree with you and also find it sad and upsetting how people of power manipulate the public into thinking what they want. The fact that companies are ignoring scientific findings on the harmful effects of their producing is upsetting. Consumers need to know what they are comsuming for their own health. For instance people kept smoking cigarettes in their household thinking it was completely safe when in reality they were not only harming themselves but the people they were living with as well. These companies paid people who the public trusted to convince them of things that were not true. I agree with your last statement of "being sorry" is not enough, we need to make changes and these companies need to keep their sorry's and make create changes as well.

I had to stop watching at times whilst watching the film “Merchants of Doubt” because of how frustrated I felt with the entire situation surrounding politics and the environment. Throughout the film it was made well aware that climate change is real thing and its occurring because of humans. This is for a fact a real phenomenon occurring in this planet. What frustrated me the most is the people for example the skeptics that are arguing against other scientist on climate change not merely because their data differs from theirs but because of politics. I hate the fact that climate change has been thrown into the middle of politics because of giant companies with money who only care about profits and completely disregard the detrimental effects that it has on the planet. 
            <br><br>

I feel like the comparisons to the tobacco companies really reflects the same situation that this generation and other Americans are in at the moment. It is really easy to convince the public and this is what the tobacco industry had been doing by discrediting other sources and leading the American public like sheep into thinking that there were no effects when truly the facts were given. The same issue applies to climate change. We know for a fact that it is hard to ignore the evidence that climate change is anthropogenic. The infuriating part is that oil companies are doing the same thing as tobacco companies and discrediting the work of other scientists and using people as sheep in politics. If change were really to come, the public should become aware of where the evidence is coming from and who is presenting it. Leading the public into the wrong judgment is completely immoral in my opinion. If we don’t solve this, climate change will be a constant struggle in any system created by humans.

Watching the "Merchants of Doubt" film was definitely a scary experience, since now my distrust for large corporations has only now grown stronger. Seeing how the tobacco industry knew that their product was harmful, but still decided to sell it anyway, shows that corporations and other large business bodies only have one true mission: profit. Even if it comes at the expense of the health of millions. One thing I appreciated about this film was that it was able to effectively extrapolate the methods of doubt-casting in the tobacco industry and apply them to the climate crisis.

            <br><br>

Fred Singer and the George C. Marshall Institute were dedicated to destroying the growing effort to combat climate change on a national, and even global level. They did this by manipulating statistics and cherry-picking data from various scientific reports, such as IPCC Climate Status reports. Their effort to manipulate this data seems juvenile to me; they claimed that average global temperatures were actually decreasing, but the data they chose to represent this claim displayed a negative trend-line of only a small portion of the average global temperature change from the 1880's until now. This cherry-picking of data horribly misrepresents modern climate change, and this type of doubt-casting only makes people more ignorant of the coming crisis that will change our lives forever.

            <br><br>

The film does a great job at showing the audience how large corporations and companies cheat and mislead their users, but it is much more vividly explained and investigated in the book that this film was based on: "Merchants of Doubt" by Erik M. Conway and Naomi Oreskes. Here, the dive into the effort to hide the real impact of climate change that was orchestrated by the Marshall Institute and other similar organizations. Watching this after reading the book reminded me that this phenomenon is much more common than we think, and that we must remember to think critically when analyzing scientific data and reports.

The movie “Merchants of Doubt” was very revealing. I was honestly shocked when I learned about all of the misleading data and propaganda that was being put out by big fossil fuel industries. The beginning of the film really grabbed my attention with the magician and how he makes an honest living by deceiving people for fun. After this magician, the film continued on and showed all of the ads about smoking cigarettes, spraying pesticides, and implementing asbestos were all great ideas until someone took a closer look at these all very harmful things. Not only were these things harmful to people, but the big corporations and companies knew that they were harmful but pushed them and advertised them regardless. In fact one of my favorite parts of the film was when Hansen revealed how someone on the inside had released millions of papers showing what was really going on and how the tobacco company knew the negative side effects of smoking and kept them hidden. Not only did they do this, but their strategy, much like the strategy in the Heartland Institute's book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, was to cause doubt in these speculations. While they couldn’t say that smoking doesn’t cause cancer, the tobacco industry implemented doubt and skepticism about the finding, saying that there was no consensus about the relationship between smoking and lung cancer or heart disease. When I heard the phrase “no consensus” I immediately thought about what’s going on in today’s world with climate change. Much of the push back that climate deniers base themselves upon is the fact that there’s no consensus that climate change is man-made. Not only was this part of the film staggering, what was more was when the fire retardant people were examining the dangerous chemicals put into furniture to prevent the furniture from catching on fire. In an attempt to show these people’s claim as false, the chemical lobbyist group Citizens for Fire Safety, paid $240,000 for Dr. Heimbach’s testimonial and his stories about the baby getting burned to death in the crib were anecdotal not real. I found this deeply disturbing. Citizens for fire safety was a small group made up of the three largest chemical flame retardant companies. They did their best to push back against the investigators but after 2 years a law was put into place that made it so furniture companies didn’t have to put flame retardant chemicals into their products.
            <br><br>
 Clearly time after time these big interest groups are trying their best to put aside the facts and inflate what lies they can to further keep their product selling and making them money. It’s like what Professor Hiltner said in his video lecture introducing this film. It’s like having $100 in the bank, but 88% of it can not be taken out or used. From a business perspective, this is bad. “Merchants of Doubt” have exposed the underlying deception that has been taking place under the nose of the public. More people need to see this film and I really hope they do because it will expose the skepticism that the deniers of climate change are trying to plant into the minds of the public. It's been revealed to me that this problem is deeply rooted and has been going on with different topics for decades, whether it was the tobacco industry years ago or climate change today.

It is quite disheartening to continue to see the unethical actions done by corporations and firms to keep their profits and bottom line going. It definitely is a parallel to what businesses did to cover up the harmful effects of smoking for so many years, in the name of profit and wealth for the higher-ups. As a consequence, smoking users developed so many cancers and health problems, that we continue to see this day with nicotine addiction and people dying earlier than they should from tobacco products. This deception and lack of disclosure from firms led to the suffering of so many. This is just like today; but instead, the firms and big businesses of fossil fuels are doing the smoking and polluting of the earth with greenhouse gases such as carbon. They have known the effects for a while, since the early 70's, but continued to pay to cover up these results because they know they will be penalized with having to limit production and at some point, seize operations once and for all. What is sad is these companies do not even want to reach a compromise, say limiting production or adopting greener practices until renewable energy takes over, but they instead go all in instead and choose to work the cheapest and what gets them the most oil/fuel. For example, fracking heavily damages the environment with air and water pollution, emits Carbon, and cause instability in the earth's core.However, these fracking machines are all-around and continue to be built. This is all due to the continual cover-up; their effects were hidden for so long, and continue to be hidden for the firm's own benefit. In addition, these corporations will pay massive dollars to boost candidates who will knock down any potential new green deals or green taxes. These candidates also promise to "bring jobs" with Oil Companies, which is often just a nice way of saying they will cut deals with fossil fuel companies and allow them to explotiate the land for a bargain and avoid many taxes. These candidates themselves often stand in solidarity with their corporations and deny climate change as well. This causes a trickle down effect, where their supports will back their candidate and agree with them and deny climate change. It is a perpetual cycle that will continue and his harmful for the future of this world.

Throughout watching the film "Merchants of Doubt" I felt extremely frustrated seeing so many people actively deceiving people and seeing America continuously repeat past mistakes. I think the filmmakers did a good job by beginning the film with the clips about cigarettes and nicotine. By showing all of the footage of the cigarette industry being exposed for blatantly lying to the public, it shows the audience that this could easily happen again. I feel like this was a very good way to introduce the film because it gets the audience thinking right at the beginning. The film was difficult to watch because we could see that with the cigarette industry, the public was clearly being fooled, and now we can see it happening all over again with climate change, only this will have an even larger effect. I thought it was very interesting to see the perspectives of some of the climate change deniers. One man that stood out to me had leaked several climate change activists' email addresses to the public. After finding out that these activists were receiving countless attacking emails and death threats, he showed no remorse or sympathy towards them, and instead acted amused and stated that he is proud of what he does and will continue to do it. This was crazy for me to see because I cannot imagine thinking this way. Overall watching this film made me incredibly frustrated, seeing so many people of power manipulate the public for their own benefit.

I found this documentary specifically interesting because it focuses on the point of view of those who don’t believe in climate change. I have seen countless articles, documentaries and social media posts about why they believe climate change is a pressing problem through the use of scientific facts. We know that there are so many large multi-million corporations and politicians that continuously ignore and deny the effects of climate change, and I think that this documentary highlights very clearly how and why they spread this belief. It never occurred to me how important it was to learn how these nonbelievers are spreading their views on this issue, because it is a very big part of the problem. The more we learn about how companies and politicians are manipulating ordinary citizens, by saying that they are taking away their “freedom” like in the instance of the tobacco companies. It took 50 years for the truth to come about about the harms of cigarettes, and their intent to make them addictive. This is quite alarming, because when you zoom out and focus on a world-wide large scale problems like climate change, we realize we don’t have 50 years for all of humanity to recognize the negative consequences. Even if we cannot stop politicians from spreading their views, we need to be educated on the ways in which they manipulate what they say, and who they are looking out for at the end of the day. How can it even be allowed for companies to pay-off individuals who paint themselves as “experts,” to trick the public into believing things that simply aren’t true. Even planting the smallest seed of doubt into individuals minds is dangerous, because it prevents immediate action against climate change. It is so irresponsible for people with so much power to circulate their versions of truths that are so harmful to our planet, purely for their own benefit.  And although this was a small part of the documentary, watching climate change activists read out email they receive that are threatening them and their families was so incredibly frustrating. The treatment they receive for trying to fight for a cause that is so important is not acceptable and undeserving.

Having read both “Climate of Doubt” and “Merchants of Doubt”, they both led me to the same question of Why does this have to be a politcal and econmic problem. In “Merchants of Doubt” it was annoying to hear James Taylor say, “it’s scientific it’s economic, it’s politcal”. I totally disagree because it should not be any of these. It’s not scientists vs other scientists. It’s not fossil fuel companies vs the planet, and it’s not the left vs right. He continued to say, “Having majored in government and taking some atmospheric science course… I am well positoned to put it together.” He is claiming that he is credible and “allowed” to say his perspective is right soley on him having taken a few atmospheric classes? I do not understand why some people in this movie feel so entitled to their opinion when it is obviously wrong. Especially because these are the same people who are saying that the very experienced scientists are wrong. Many aspects of this movie exposed how the right side often does what they can just to oppose the left. Because many of the conservative “scientists” disagreed with the IPCC, they decided to create the NIPCC (Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change). I think this shows how “petty?” the cliamte change deniers are. It shows how ignorant they are in not being able to see what crisis we are in.

It is mind boggling to me how far reaching a companies influence can be. Merchants of Doubt goes over the reach of the tobacco industry. There was an issue in the 70s with houses catching on fire because cigarettes were not being put out and they could burn for 30 minutes after being set down. The tobacco industry was pushed to change cigarettes to put themselves out, but did not want to change their product because it was bringing them billions of dollars a year. Because of this, the tobacco industry planted a person in the fire department to say the issue was not the cigarettes which were causing the fire, but the fact that the furniture was not fire resistant, so this caused couches and other pieces of furniture to be filled with fire retardant, causing health problems in people in the USA. All because the cigarette industry did not want to change their ways.

The conservative ex senator Inglis was a very interesting perspective to include. He was a conservative Christian senator for six years, but then once he began supporting climate change, he was instantly voted out of office. He was even shown debating conservatives in Mississippi over climate change, and was completely shut down. When people are given one perspective for their whole lives, and their livelihoods depend upon it (on coal use as well as jobs in the industry) it is very difficult to convince them otherwise.

<p>
Watching this film was very informative for me.  I knew that the climate debate has been largely politically polarized and converted for economic gain, but I found that this film described the path of this phenomenon in a way I had not heard before.  Although I was appalled by this information, I was not surprised.  Money and power are very powerful influencers for humans, so when the climate crisis became an economic issue it makes perfect sense that those being negatively impacted will begin to stir up a fuss.  It also does not surprise me that the conservative influencer’s goal was not to convince people that climate change was not happening; it was simply to place doubt in the consumer’s mind so that they believed continuing their current way of life full of fossil fuels was not directly leading to the destruction of the planet.
            <br><br>


It makes me incredibly frustrated that action or inaction on climate change is only an issue because of money and politicians.  It does not matter if someone believes climate change is human caused or not; all that matters is that we know the earth is warming and if it keeps warming it will soon become uninhabitable for humans.  It does not matter how famous someone is or how much money they have or their social standing if there are no people to impress because everyone has died from climate change.  It seems so selfish to me that humans are unwilling to look at the bigger picture of possible destruction of all life on earth in favor of the newest money-making scheme or political campaign.  In reality, I think that people only deny climate change because they can profit by providing skewed information to the public for money or fame.

“Merchant of Doubt” was an interesting and eye opening film that showed us how many important  people in the past denied climate change and with their power managed to convince the public that it wasn’t true as well. I found it extremely insane how tobacco companies had the public convinced that their fires were being caused by furniture and not by the cigarettes they were smoking indoors. They paid firefighters insane amounts of money for them to tell people that their fires were caused by their furniture. When a doctor was brought up in the film during the court scene he mentioned that he had dealt with a baby who died because his mom put a candle inside of the crib and that the crib did not have flame retardants. First of all, who in their right mind would put a lit candle inside a crib that has a baby? Second of all, this story was a lie this surgeon got paid thousands of dollars to tell the public and he admitted it yet people still believed him. When confronted about his lies in court the doctor simply said he was not under oath so he could say anything he pleased. 
            <br><br>
This film shows what has already happened in the past and does a great job of showing how companies use different kinds of people that the public trusts (doctors, firefighters, scientists, etc.) to brainwash them into thinking that their products are completely safe and not the problem. Although this film focuses on some things that happened in the past it's relevant to today as it's still happening around us. For instance e-cigarettes were once advertised as safer than regular cigarettes but this is not true and unfortunately it took many deaths for the public to understand this just like it took many homes burning down for people to understand that the furniture was not the issue.

I had always wondered about why the general public of America has such a hard time getting on board with the fact that the climate crisis is a very real threat to our society.  In the film, “Merchants of Doubt”, I finally understood why there were people who are still not acting on behalf of our earth.  The most compelling evidence that was brought forth and what shocked me the most was the small group of men that were lobbying on behalf of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gasses.  The way that they played the public by introducing doubt and confusion on the topic for the sake of delaying the inevitable legislation on the matter made me furious.  They know that not enough people take the time to look into the issue if it is much easier to accept that “not all scientists agree” on the basis of man-made climate change.  They use that confusion and misinformation, like the fact that over 30,000 scientists agreed even though most of them were not even scientists or real names, to their advantage to keep pumping as much CO2 into our atmosphere and extracting as many resources as they can until more people catch onto what they are doing.  They are acting in their own interest and do not care what the costs are to the planet as long as they are making as much money as they can.

            <br><br>

I also liked hearing from a former skeptic on climate change because I could see the impact that research and facts have on an individual if they take the time to look into the topic.  People get so stuck in their views and then only listen to the facts that confirm their previous opinions.  Hearing that a man who built his career around being a skeptic is now speaking at conferences to refute his previous statements because he was open minded enough to accept that he was wrong in the past and new evidence suggests the opposition’s point of view was very uplifting.  It showed that people have the capability to change if they aren’t too stubborn and can only accept information that is presented to them if it aligns with their ideas.

Watching "A Climate of Doubt" was like watching a very badly filmed satire comedy. Honestly, how can anyone look at the faces of these climate change deniers and not laugh. Even though the effects of climate change is no laughing matter, the claims and defenses of the deniers is equivalent to sheer stupidity or just plain ignorance. The fact that Republicans and Democrats were on the same page on accepting climate change at one point was something that surprised me. But the Republicans swayed back to outright denying it due to the rage of their constituents and the fistfuls of dollars shoved in their pockets by the wealthy fossil fuel industry. I am excited to see where will end up by the end of this year once the election is over and if we have finally made progress in implementing changes to mitigate the disasters to come.

When watching the Frontline documentary "A Climate of Doubt," I was angry, to say the least.

            <br><br>

I wasn't the least bit surprised at the type of people backing the fight against climate change; they were all of the older generation. What surprised me was the amount of backing they seemed to be receiving from the American people. I was reminded of, for what i considered to be, the theme of the 2016 election and the driving force behind the backing of anti-climate change movement: Fear. It amazes just how great of a tool material wealth and fear of losing it can be used to manipulate people. To me, it seems as though the common American is being persuaded and duped into supporting politicians who draw them by inciting fear of things like greater taxes and infringement on our god-given freedoms. 
            <br><br>

What bothered me more was the lack of real evidence against climate change, just blanket statements used to draw in the masses. CO2 is important for living life? Really? Yea, thank you captain obvious!  For an opposing argument that seems so hard bent on preserving the merits of both science and an open-minded way of thinking, it seems to be that more thought and money is being put into how to manipulate people into confusion and chaos while we LITERALLY inch closer and closer to environmental collapse.
            <br><br>

What sucks most of all is, at the end of the day while our generation and future generations are working effortlessly to rewrite the previous wrongdoings of the past, all we will have to guide us will be the previous generation's misdeeds and a few thousands "We were wrong"s from the grave.

I love this post. I agree that most of the people against climate change are just older people who have been polluting the environment for years now and are fight to continue doing it because of the money they are getting from it. They truly are blinded by the fact that they will lose money if they stop emitting to see how they are affecting the generations to come. One of the more disturbing facts is that these same people and companies are now doubling down on burning fossil fuels to get every last drop they can before they won't be allowed to do it anymore! Hopefully it doesn't get so bad that we cannot come back from it.

I think the most striking thing about this video is the attention it draws to the media and their role in mitigating the climate crisis. The fact that over thirty thousand scientists would sign a statement that dismisses climate issues is horrific to think about, that educated “professionals” would actively work in opposition to what has the potential to cause the next mass extinction, is nothing less than terrifying. For decades, actual specialists on climate change, as well as media and film outlets, have made attempts to draw attention to this ever growing issue, yet their voices seem to be drowned out by their ignorant opposition. The reality is that people would rather make money than look at the possible destruction their actions have on the planet.  I would be interested to know who is providing the funding for these scientists that stand by their comments against the climate crisis to see if they align with the big corps that are destroying our planet.

The film, “A Climate of Doubt” was very eye-opening and upsetting to see how much lack of action there is amongst people to act on this issue. The climate crisis is a real problem and Ken's video gave more insight as to how many people with power positions deny the effects that humans take in the issue. Ken's analogies made it very clear as to why such big industries would rather deny the negative effects the release of fossil fuels have in our atmosphere. The fact that these industries gain a substantial amount from the release of carbon emissions should raise red flags to those who are skeptical and side with the industries over the issue. 
            <br><br>
The film became very surprising to me when I heard the way Fred Singer spoke over the climate issue.  In his eyes, the climate changes on its own with no impacts made to the atmosphere by humans. Singer, like many other politicians and people with power, deny that there is a climate crisis issue. I find this very alarming because like Ken says in the video, teaching others to deny the climate crisis issue will only continue to drag on the effects. It is truly sad to know that out of personal gain a large number of people will turn a blind eye and deny the way fossil fuels affect climate change.

Regarding your comment about people in power, I totally agree that this is only great pushing the fight back and closer to not being able to come back from our mistakes. It is sad that these are the people that we look up to and we ask to represent for us and do what is best for us. However, these people seem to value money more than the well being of the people they represent. These people then push these ideas back on us, and with the power and influence they have, they even end up making many people believe them. It astonishes me that these people are so greedy that they value the money more than the future of the world. Many of these people have families and kids, and it's hard for me to believe that they can continue to push this false narrative that they have to know is false with so much evidence to back it up. As a politician, you are voted in to be true and represent your people, not to represent the businesses and companies. These businesses are running the country more than the people are, taking away from the ideals of democracy.

I believe I had mentioned something similar to this in a comment on a previous week’s lecture video, but it is horridly fascinating to see the lengths that some people will go in order to mark climate change off as a conspiracy. That was my primary thought while watching the documentary “Climate of Doubt.” I was not surprised at all when, in the beginning of the documentary, Fred Singer says, “There’s nothing wrong with climate. It’ll change no matter what we do.” I was unsurprised because this seems to be the mentality that a majority of climate change deniers have. I feel more exasperated with this than anything. Whenever I see or hear people put in so much effort to debunk the data that we worry about, I wonder what could get done if their efforts were going towards helping climate change instead of disproving it.

Again it shows how greedy industries associate with fossil fuels are unwillingly to cut out any profits they hold. One could say it causes the denial of climate change because admitting it means less profits, and yet the denials not only reinforced the greed. It ultimately becomes the force that spread and support fake information about climate changes since the political power is mainly held by those industries. It's could be the ignorance inside those peoples' mind that make them believe that "what was working fine before should work fine again in the future", which is obviously not true since cannibals existed doesn't also make them cannibals. But what they are doing today, right now are way worse than cannibalism, and what disturbs me the most is the possibility that they claimed to not believe in things that "sounds scientific" simply to fool people who have faiths on them. They simply might just don't care since they won't live long enough to see a world doomed by climate changes. In conclusion, either they are ignorant or evil, another force, which is us, needs to present itself and take controls over politics. The option of ignoring politics because they are "less interesting" or "not relevant" will no longer work.

After watching the documentary, “A Climate of Doubt”, I had my resentment for politicians reaffirmed once again. As the movie made a point to mention, these representatives are some of the last people standing in the way of global acceptance and education of anthropogenic climate change. Due to their consistent denial of climate change, only 50% of Americans believe that the climate crisis is man made. This number is staggering because I find it hard to believe that deniers could hold that much power over public opinion, but the film made it clear the impact big corporations and politicians have over the general public. 

            <br><br>

The film also showed the different ways that climate deniers formed their negative arguments. One of these cases was by testifying that climate change would have little impact. This was honestly the most baffling argument made by the deniers because from a scientific perspective, there is no way that our level of climate change could have anything other than negative consequences. When Fred Singer said that we would just “have to wait a little,” I was really irritated. These people do not understand the severity of the issue. There is no waiting, if we do not act it will only end in our own destruction.

I just want to say, I completely agree with you. I firmly believe that it is absurd how climate change is such a political problem. The death of the climate is not politics, that is the life of humanity. It is so irritating and I was more angered after watching "A Climate of Doubt. I agree when you say that these politicians and deniers of climate change simply do not comprehend or acknowledge the genuine severity and urgency of climate change and the minimal time frame we have. We cant simply wait things out anymore. It is honestly crazy the level of ignorance that these people have. I mean I just don't get how they could actually deny what is happening and has been happening for years. 
            <br><br>
Climate Change hasn't been viewed as a threat to safety and life. Instead these people see ways of making the most money off of the situation and suffering of others. Again, climate change is not politics. We cant be so divided on such a straightforward trouble that will affect us all if we do not act now. 
            <br><br>
After watching this, I am even more concerned. I am scared that this is not a rare thing to have such ignorant people. I am worried that if these people ever realize their mistakes, it will be too late to save anything. The time limit we have is running out and very fast.
<br><hr>

Kevin Tessier your comment at the end about deniers finally realizing their mistakes after it is already too late really resonated with me. In the film when Myron Ebell responded to being asked “what if all the climate skeptics were wrong” with a short “I’d be sorry”, I was angered to no end! As you said the amount of ignorance being displayed by people, especially those with public influence like Ebell, has reached an all time high. A person in their position of power should be an advocate for change, not the opposite! I honestly do not think a simple apology would anywhere near enough to undo all the damage these climate change deniers have caused, but that seems to be all they would potentially have to offer us. That really makes for a rather upsetting revelation.

Watching “Climate of Doubt” I wasn’t at all surprised at the nature of skeptics. Their stances are completely based on money, greed, and politics. They purposely confuse the misinformed into thinking that initiatives to better the environment will destroy their ways of life. American for prosperity being the group I'm mentioning and others like them. A lot of issues now could’ve been resolved if they took the initiative 8 years ago. This made me go on a mental tangent on why Americans should be more responsible for their knowledge. I realized that when it comes to studies/new information on climate change the average individual isn’t receiving this information on their own and most of the time it’s being delivered to them through news outlets or politicians. So when people don’t know any better they take the information that they hear as truth. Like imagine if the skeptics from the documentary had  sought out truthful evidence on their own merit rather than from other skeptics. Imagine the republicans protesting in Americans for prosperity, if those people were well informed we wouldn’t be in a situation so dire as we are now. I mean I can’t say I’ve put in the work to pursue the truth but what this documentary proved to me is that close mindedness is responsible for the situation we are now. But I noticed in today’s culture, our generation is trying more and more to seek the truth because we are the ones going to be most affected by this crisis.

<p>
Personally, I am glad that I watched the documentary “A Climate of Doubt”, because it made it clear of what is happening today and how much the republicans take it as a joke. It was really disappointing to see such a serious matter taken as a humorous joke. This was seen during a speech that he would shout “Global warming is” and then the crowd would reply back with “B.S.” It truly saddens me that people are supporting people who deal with such matters as so. There was another comment made throughout the documentary that I could not get my head around: “Pollution (CO2) is plant food”. How could someone possibly believe that our production of CO2 is benefiting the livelihood of living things. Witnessing this documentary made me understand how the other side is taking this issue into account and that there needs to be a change fast. 
            <br><br>

I didn’t understand clearly the goals of the deniers denying it and telling the whole world about it until watching Ken’s video. It is clear to me now that these deniers are trying to solely create major confusion which results in the public unlikely to support an increase in taxes for the end of the climate crisis. When Ken used the $100 example to understand the end result of keeping 88% of the earth’s coal reserves underground I understood the cost that it would bring these big companies with which they depend. However, would they rather it be the cost of their companies or the cost of the ability to live on planet earth? This battle that is currently underway for the support of the American public is definitely a matter that we as a whole need to take control of. This battle should not be based around political views, rather, it should be based on a world situation that does not have any positive outcomes.

I definitely agree with you that "A Climate of Doubt" made me realize how delusional climate deniers really are. Most of them only care about their own personal profit and don't think twice about how they are destroying our Earth and the future of their children. I wholeheartedly cannot imagine that they are unaware of the damage they are doing. Instead, I think they just don't care. They know that the climate crisis is real but since they benefit from fossil fuel companies and big corporations, they deny it to try and make themselves feel better. It is truly sad how people can be so reckless and irresponsible with the planet we have been given.
            <br><br>


One of the scenes that really shocked me was when Myron Ebell was asked what he would do if he eventually discovered he was wrong about climate change being a hoax. His response was "I would be sorry". This just shows how out of touch with reality these people are. How is that the only thing he would say to his defense? His apologies will do absolutely nothing because by the time everyone realizes the danger we are in, it will already be too late. The worst thing is, climate deniers don't even care. As long as they are going to be fine, they won't think twice about all the people affected by climate change.
            <br><br>
This documentary made me kind of lose hope that we will ever be able to convince the general public that the climate crisis is a legitimate threat to our existence. Those people don't even want to learn. They are so convinced by themselves and they don't even realize what's wrong with that. It really makes me wonder if our population will ever take climate change seriously.

I have previously seen both "A Climate of Doubt" and "Merchants of Doubt" but I re-watched them both. I can honestly say that they still baffle me. The part of me that roots for the villain in stories almost cant help but be impressed by these people. Knowing that they put their own self interest ahead of the health of thousands of people is insane– nothing new, of course, but still shocking– and feels like a movie. The idea that inspiring confusion among the public, who policy makers turn to for opinion on new policy, is so wild. It surprises me that they still get away with it. Having money in the US is like having as many get out of jail free cards as you want– I would even argue that our democracy has been morphing into a plutocracy, a government overseen by the wealthy, over the last half a century. 
            <br><br>
I am a strong believer in the idea that if you learn from history, you can avoid making the same mistakes, but when huge corporations put money behind something that they want to protect (likely because it is generating even more money), it almost doesn't matter if you can see a pattern developing; they can stall for decades, milk the consumers that buy into the doubt, and no one is ever held accountable. It is unfortunate because regulations are what keep the public safe, and because corporations can throw money at an issue and sprinkle some doubt on top, you have to stay incredibly informed if you want to live a healthy life. Which is not fair, especially to people who are mainly just worried about getting their daily bread. The government, in my opinion, should operate as a force to protect it's citizens in the face of profit hungry corporations.

Much like the reading for this week, I felt the same rush of anger and pure annoyance after watching “A Climate of Doubt”. Even moreso, it made me even angrier because I could physically see these claims coming out of their mouth and not just one-sided remarks on paper. Without even involving politics, their beliefs are based on pure stupidity and religious beliefs. It was once said that there is a separation between church and state; but as we have come to find out now, church has completely taken over the Republican political world. If the phrases, “tired of Obama, try Jesus; Jesus is my savior, not the government” or “scientists are godless liberals” do not scare you, then you are in too deep. Pertaining to the documentary, it was actually interesting to see how quiet Republicans get when faced with the truth– especially when their belief is rebuked by scientific facts. Most, if not all, are not shy to speak their opinion on controversial issues that they know will get them press, such as being pro-life, their stance on gun control, or the hoax of police brutality. Why can’t they shut their mouths about an innocent black person dying at the hands of our supposed ‘protectors’ but will become completely silent on the detrimental future of our planet? It is not hard to see that we have caused this, and frankly, they are just delusional because they know they are the ones who caused it. If it wasn’t obvious enough, every single person who denied the climate crisis in the documentary was old, white, and rich. They simply do not want to speak the truth because they know they’ll be held accountable. Instead, they would do as much as running away from reporters and into an elevator in order to avoid comments. It wasn’t as if they were specifically targeting Republicans; “Only Republicans question science… it is rare to find a Democrat who outright denies the pretence of science.” Although there are some Democrats who are questionable (cough Kamala Harris), they at least have the decency to not deny science and actually are smart enough to understand that the natural course of nature does not cause 20 wildfires in a single decade. As Ken said, “no place on Earth will be left untouched” and that includes their multi-million dollar mansions that cause their immense carbon footprint. These politicians believe that their huge bank accounts will be their savior– but too bad the Earth doesn’t care about money. It is not a debate that out world will soon go up in flames. They are so caught up in the land of politics that simple matters such as these are a hard pill to swallow, but once they realize the reality of our future, it will be too late. Especially for them.

I watched the documentary "A Climate of Doubt" and was shocked by how much I didn't know about the recent politics surrounding climate change. I also previously read the book "Merchants of Doubt" and found a lot of similar patterns regarding the handling of the climate crisis by scientists and politicians across decades. In both cases skeptics relied on small groups of loyal scientists who would find ways to support their false claims. The documentary mentions how when interpreting data scientists may choose certain segments of data that support the idea that the earth is cooling when in reality the scientists simply ignore the data as a full picture. I wasn't aware before that congress was making progress with creating climate change legislation like the Cap and Change Approach. Disappointingly the bill was shut down by skeptics claiming that the bill would hurt the economy and take away people's jobs. Instead fossil fuel companies continue to drill into the earth releasing more CO2 emissions and making more of a profit everyday.

I have now watched both "A Climate of Doubt" and "Merchants of Doubt." Personally I liked Merchants of Doubt better. It really showed you how business oriented some of these people were. The incorporation of both the cigarette example and the magician was really cool as I felt it grabbed my attention more and kept me interested. It boggles my mind how many people hold economical interests over humanitarian interests, especially if a certain product or condition causes death. As much as I hate to admit it these fossil fuel companies and the people they hire are incredibly smart as they put out false information, put on a good face for the company, and satisfy investors. I ask my self the question of how much money means to me, and lately its been less due in part to films like these. Right now Australia is severely damaged and along with that the growing number of fires, temperature records, ice caps melting, etc. people somehow still don't see the effects of climate change! There is literally no debate about it anymore and it is as simple as having the general public take a stand. We give these companies power at the end of the day and we just need to realize we have most of the power!

After watching “A Climate of Doubt,” the thing that struck me most is how recently climate change became politically divided. The film mentions that Republicans and Democrats alike had a general sort of consensus that climate change was a real issue in 2008. Although there were skeptics, the majority of people and politicians alike were beginning to address the problem. What’s crazy is just how much doubt and uncertainty fossil fuel companies were able to create with their influence. By 2012, the film points to multiple examples of politicians changing their stance on climate change quoting that the science is unclear. There are now entire organizations backing the ideas of climate denial. The film mentions both the Heartland Institute and the Americans for Prosperity. Each has reasonably large influences and continues to call claims of climate change into doubt. Worse, one of their strategies is to cause chaos and confusion by underscoring the problem. The film mentions that these organizations labeled politicians and scientists who supported climate change reforms as alarmists. They mentioned “manipulated data” and conspiracy. I find it incredibly frustrating that so many people, from the oil companies to new outlets, are willing to downplay climate change in exchange for heaps of profit. There was a quote from a climate denier, Ebell’s, who said if he was wrong he would simply be sorry. That's it?? Simply sorry? The movie talks about people being forced to migrate, the diminishing fish population, and the millions who will suffer from the advancement of climate change. There’s just too much destruction that ensues for us if we can’t unite and fight climate change, yet climate change deniers are trying to spread their influence everywhere. I think this movie needs to be seen by everyone conservative and liberal alike. I think it's a great tool for convincing climate deniers that maybe their position is influenced by people who are greedy for wealth.

This film (Climate of Doubt) focused on sharing the political view of the climate crisis. It showed how many people didn’t care about trying to reduce the carbon emissions until they realized it will make an impact in the economy. Many people were upset with Cap and Trade because it would increase taxes and cause a lot of people to lose their jobs. This film made me question how some people think about climate change. They people who are denying climate change seem to just be throwing out random information to make the whole thing seem dumb. In the video someone simply said that carbon dioxide is plant food, implying that it is a good thing for the increase of CO2. There was another man named Fred Singer who was just denying everything that was stated. In an interview with John Hockenberry you can see him giving very simple replies when asked about climate change. He just says that it is false and when he is asked if most climate scientists believe it is true then they are deluded and he just replies “yes.” When he is asked if he sees something they don’t he simply says “yes.” He doesn’t go on to try and backup what he says, he is only keeping the debate going.
            <br><br>

After watching this film I learned just how difficult it is to make any sort of progress in the political area of climate change. There will always be people denying it and making a huge debate on the situation, causing the process of taking action to come to a halt.  I’m sure that many of the big companies who are responsible for these carbon emissions also have strong connections with the government in order to stop any sort of progress that will affect their profits.

What happened to Bob Inglis was incredibly outrageous. Climate change should not be a partisan issue, or treated the way something like balancing the budget would be. While important, partisan issues should be just political. Climate change is not political at all: it is scientific fact. It is real, it is happening, and it is making broad swaths of our planet uninhabitable for all of Earth's current denizens. But the fact that Inglis lost his political career as a conservative because he evaluated the facts and the science presented to him, and came to the (correct) conclusion that climate change is a huge threat, reveals that even hard facts can be made into a partisan issue. Science really isn't valued in the U.S. unless it is exploitable for profit.
            <br><br>

What's also incredibly frustrating to me is that renewable energy IS actually exploitable for a profit; not only do we need to restructure our society to be less reliant on fossil fuels, but switching to renewables can create new jobs and generate profit for companies as fossil fuels become less favorable. Creating a "climate of doubt" just seems to me like the last-ditch effort of massive companies to continue generating massive amounts of wealth without having to innovate or be held accountable for the damage they are causing. Or at least, it would seem like a last ditch effort, if fossil fuel companies hadn't been doing this for literal decades. I can't fathom why more Americans aren't watching "Climate of Doubt" or "Merchants of Doubt" and becoming enraged; we were being lied to, we ARE being lied to. When is the public going to wake up to this reality?

<p>
Although "A Climate of Doubt" is 8 years old, it frustrates me to know that there are still people, politicians, and industries that ignore the facts and overlook the disasters that have already happened due to climate change. I feel that the people who say climate change is a hoax are afraid of carrying the responsibility of having to take action because it's harder to accept the truth and change than it is to remain stagnant. It's disappointing to know that many politicians don't have the liberty to stand up for what they think because they'd rather say and do what they're told to by lobbyist and fossil-fuel industries. Politicians know that Climate Change is a sensitive issue to talk about and instead of listening to the scientists who have devoted their lives to gathering up data that proves the climate is changing they rather listen to the money and become a hoax themselves. These skeptics are literally pulling their "data" out of their ass to make up a science that is more convenient for them. Like the graph demonstration they gave, the graph was clearly rising overall but skeptics will look at the short phases in which they're "declining" and it's doesn't mean that the global temperature is declining it means that its just changing all the time and its changing now more than ever. 
            <br><br>
Its scary to think that our fate and the fate of the future generations lie in the hands of our politicians, politicians that most of the time don't represent the things we want but rather the things massive corporations want, and these corporations couldn't care less about the way the people are affected by their dirty work. Its always been about money and I'm afraid that it'll continue to be that way. We really don't have the time to be arguing about whether this is a problem or not, we should be talking about what we're going to do as a nation and take action before this decade ends because things that were said in Wallace-Well's article are already happening; just last week in Canberra, Australia a storm with larger than usual hail came in and now we're seeing the outbreak of the Coronavirus that started in China and has already spread to several countries including some cases here in the U.S... these kind of things were predicted to happen decades from now and they've already begun, what the future holds is completely unpredictable now.

After watching the film, A Climate of Doubt, I learned a lot of information about human-caused climate change, observed scientific proof discovered by scientists, and witnessed how data can be skewed to hide the truth. Before watching the film, I was skeptical about the severity of damage human-caused climate change was having on our planet. However, now that I have been informed, my standpoint on the importance of making changes to stop global warming from increasing has changed dramatically. I am also now aware about how the data can be skewed by non-believers of climate change to show proof of “global cooling,” when in reality every ten years the overall temperature of the planet increases. Sea levels are also rising and in North Carolina can expect a rise of 39 inches in the future according to researchers. Contrarians of global warming such as Fred Singer also mention the Oregon Petition, which was signed by some scientists (along with celebrities and friends) that states global warming is not occurring or due to human activity. This petition shouldn’t be taken seriously to debunk accepted science by 97% of scientists around the globe. Contrarians also point to “Climategate” as evidence that scientists have been skewing with data to promote the hoax of climate change, however the internal emails that leaked did not show this. Chairman Upton and Republican members of Congress are hesitant to acknowledge human-caused climate change, which is very alarming.
            <br><br>


The reason why some people are so against the idea of climate change is because they don’t want dollars coming out of their pockets to fund research or pay for ways to stop climate change from occurring. In my opinion, the population should think about the future generations and how our actions now can affect them negatively later rather than how much money it would cost. I would rate this film a four out of five because it was effective in communicating the effects of climate change and how contrarians attempt to skew with evidence of global warming. I am going to recommend this movie to my family and friends so that they can be aware of human-caused climate change and how we can help.

After watching “Climate of doubt” it left me very disheartened in the people who partake in the anti-climate change debate. It was interesting to see how the majority of people advocating against climate change were white educated men. To see how how climate skeptics would just say “sorry” if they were wrong shows the ignorance that is building their campaign. How could people not care about the millions and billions of lives at stake with the climate change that IS effecting our world. It is silly to think about how the men who are supposed to be acclaimed academic scholars would so quickly and without regret alter a graph like that of Singer’s to show false information to convince people. The thing that bothered me the most was how much politics mattered to the anti-climate change people. They knew that if they could control the politics that they could control how the factual science would be perceived. It is disgusting to think about how they focus on politics instead of the hard facts, but makes sense because they have to be able to control the information they put out for the world to see effectively. By getting a big enough following, the climate skeptics could nudge their way into the political world, backed by fossil fuel companies who would later influence republican lawmakers to create laws that would silence any progress to combat climate change.

In the film the Climate of Doubt the political version of climate change was the main focus.  In this film skeptics were given a light to give their opinion on the issue of climate change. It's frustrating seeing these governmental representatives denying the science behind climate change and referring to scientists' research as an "opinion" rather than fact. Before "Climategate" occurred the opinion of skeptics did not have weight and was constantly considered invalid. I think that is ridiculous that they continue to weigh in on these emails as a form of counter attack even after it has been found that the research conducted by the scientists was not mishandled. The weight of a 97% consensus versus emails that were proven to not represent the handling of their findings is significantly higher, yet skeptics were able to pry their way into the house and convince people otherwise.
            <br><br>


Climate change should not be a question and it should not divide people. The state of our world and the futures of our children will be impacted on our action that we take today. I think it is evil that fossil fuel companies are robbing the progression that was made on the awareness and credibility of climate change. The fact that the agreeance of a global issue allowed for someone to lose their job and create turmoil in their current career is not acceptable. I appreciated what Bob Inglis said about the issue and compared it to the treatment of a child when the majority of doctors agree that it would be most effective to take a course of action.
            <br><br>


I thought that the reasoning that CO2 was good for the environment because it is "life" is extremely ignorant and is steering people in the wrong direction. It is true that carbon dioxide is taken up by plants but that does not mean that they are able to uptake all the emissions we produce. This comment has not scientific background for it to be verified and shows that those who do agree with this comment are not knowledgeable about climate change in general. They question the validity of 97% of scientists when their argument is not sound.

The film  “Merchants of Doubt” really surprise me and make me feel disappointed. Watching this film, i was told that tobacco company ignored the fact that cigarettes are actually causing cancer and fire that killing people and causing climate crisis. Cigarettes are harmful. And the tobacco company still claim that cigarettes are not addicted and try to convince people that it’s good for us. 
            <br><br>
What they do to deal with those facts are really disappoint me. When tobacco company are facing the fact that cigarette making people die because of fire caused by burning cigarettes, tobacco company don’t want create self-extinguishing cigarette since they don’t want to alter a product that making them billions of dollar a year, so they find a scapegoat - furniture. And when they are facing with undeniable evidence that smoking was causing cancer and killing people, they hired a pubic relation firm - Hill and Knowlton. They even arranged a spy, Peter Sparber, to be the legislative representative of fire marshals to convince people that it’s not cigarettes causing fire but furniture. 
            <br><br>

Some people said that science is complicated and it includes many factors. So climate might change naturally and it might be caused by sunspot or wobble of the Earth. It’s not difficult to persuade people who are not sure whether climate crisis are caused by human actions by saying these words. Some people claimed that more data are needed and science cannot make a determination. Other people even said more pollution is good for us as a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere will produce a tremendous greening of Planet Earth.
            <br><br>

I don't know how the company and these scientists think when they are telling people that cigarettes cause no harm and at the same time facing the fact that cigarettes are actually killing people and causing climate change. But it's really an urgent to take actions.

“The Climate of Doubt” was an infuriating watch, I must admit. The main takeaway I took from this was people, especially politicians, are willfully ignorant to the issue of climate change in order to push their own agendas. Myron Ebell, in response to being asked what if climate scientists and himself were wrong, he simply responded “sorry”. If that alone does not show you how disconnected these people are from the issue at hand, I don’t know what will. He, and thousands of other policy makers and influencers are willing to risk the lives of millions, if not billions of people, in order to keep the fossil fuel industry intact and preserve their wealth. His complete lack of regard to the possible, or rather impending, consequence of his actions show how removed from the situation these people truly are. 
            <br><br>


Another issue with this film is that they claimed democrats were pushing their own agendas though climate change and demonized them and called them the “radical left” as a means of making them lose support and invalidating their claim. The irony behind this is most of the Heartland Institute’s funding is from conservative, fossil fuel interest groups who stand to lose money if climate change is proved true. Thus, it’s no surprise that they are doing everything in their power to disapprove it and discredit those who use their voices for a positive change, like Obama attempted to do with the cap and trade. In theory, it is an excellent idea designed to keep pollution to a minimum, but people's fear of losing jobs prevented it from ever actually being effectively implemented. 

            <br><br>

In conclusion, my main takeaway from this video is that interest groups are trying to instill doubt in the minds of the American public in an attempt to maximize their profits. They have no care for the lives that will inevitably be lost, particularly amongst the poor or those in nations which will be especially affected. And because the average citizen is unlikely to look up evidence refuting the claim and are therefore easily swayed, it seems as though the climate change crisis is a battle that will be raging still even after current politicians and major corporation heads have left the earth.

I agree completely. The fact that politicians and interest groups in general are trying to undermine the gravity of climate change is made evident through their policies and political agendas. And in contrast we can see how having people in power who actually understand and are working to alleviate the issue can indeed shift the public opinion. For example, there was much more funding and urgency in regards to the climate crisis under the Obama administration as opposed to Trump's who try to trivialize the situation, even though much more could and should have been done under the former

<br><br>
It's sad that the ones who wield power can make decisions regarding the state of the planet while they reside in the luxury of their homes. Sadly, this is why I believe it will take something of a large scale to finally push the policy makers the realize the peril that we are in, something that affects them directly.

"The Climate of Doubt" was also a frustrating watch for me. It's so infuriarting how disconnected these politicians are from reality. They are so money driven that they willfully ignore the gigantic issue of climate change. It also annoyed me, hearing Myron Ebell's response. How nonchalantly he responded to something so real that is happening right now. Do these politicians not realize that we only have one planet and we are in the process of making it uninhabitable within the next few decades? Sure, they can pretend nothing is wrong but sooner or later, we will all be facing the consequences. I also find it amazingly ironic how the film claims that democrats are pushing their own agendas through agendas when the Heartland Institute is literally funded by conservative, fossil fuel interest groups to push their own agenda. It's so dangerous that these interest groups are trying to spread misinformation. Lies are the last thing we need. We can pretend that climate change doesn't exist but it will not make our problems go away.
<br><Hr>
You're definitely hitting the right points. Your comments reminded me of my reaction in the last reading we had. This film, “A Climate of Doubt” is all useless propaganda; energy used to create something that will have no positive contribution for the health of every living organism on the planet in the long run. These films are results of companies taking a hit from the very real threats of over exploiting our environment. With an unprecedented proliferation of information, much of us have exposure to information that teaches us about what's bad and good for the environment. What’s scary is that a lot of the skeptics/contrarians on global warming are people that are in power; people who are in the perfect position to make an impact on preserving the planet. The Cooler Heads Coalition for example are very cable figures in our society. They have the power, the funding, the influence, and also the facts about this issue. Politicians and scientists that are part of this Coalition are implementing practices that are motivated by profit. A major concept I picked up from this film is that the information we are exposed to in our multimedia generation are coming sources with multi-vocal authenticity. This means that the information has been influenced by multiple people or voices in the process of it’s fabrication. In the film it said that “If you pay a scientist enough, he can find the data you need to back up anything.” This is definitely alarming because for a price one can credibly deceit and amass doubt from  people that believe every professional looking information they see. The only thing this people need is an inch of doubt from us, once  we have the slightest confusion about the real facts due to this biased dates being released, our doubt can easily become a prominent factor in the way we live our lives.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you in everything you stated in you’re comment. For many years now, politicians and interest groups have totally been blinded by their wealth and have become completely selfish with no regards for the people being affected in poorer countries and areas. They have tried to sway people into thinking that there is no climate crisis and that there is no true problem going on in our world. As you said , they are being willfully ignorant in order to push their own agendas and continue with the fossil fuel industry.
<br><br>

It's devastating to me that there are thousands, even millions of people, that are truly worried about Earth and its climate, but aren't able to do anything because they have restricted actions they can take to help. It's sad a lot of these people are poor and can't raise awareness as easily as wealthier people like these ignorant businessmen who only care about themselves.
<br><Hr>
I agree. "The Climate of Doubt" really makes me worry about the damaging impact of climate change deniers on our future. I can't tell if Myron Ebell and politicians who echo his agenda don't understand the scientific truth of the climate crisis, or if they do in fact understand and decide to willfully douse themselves in bathtubs of money and accelerate the ship towards the iceberg. What if we indeed reach the tipping point of no return? Will the money-driven, dishonest conservative interest groups be sorry for their disillusioned propaganda that they so nonchalantly chanted once upon a time?
<br><br>

Actually, speaking of recent crises, I can't help but pray for the victims of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, which was also a man-made disaster due to ineffective disease control policies. When will people understand that just because something that devastates all of us doesn't happen yet, doesn't mean that we shouldn't wake up to reality now and act before time runs out?

<br><Hr>
I totally agree with you. Many of the politicians are denying the fact that climate change is happening and it is caused by human actions because they are afraid that they will not make as much money as when climate change is not happening/climate change is not or have not yet to be proved to be true. Those are not what a politician supposed to be like. People will be or even are suffering from the climate crisis, and being the politicians of one of those countries that are at the top of the production of carbon dioxide are denying what is happening right now is a shame. That may sound harsh, but even 153 years ago, in the Gettysburg Adress, Lincoln said that the government of America is “... of the people, by the people, for the people…”. However, when it comes to climate crisis nowadays, they seem to forget that they are working for the country and the people who live in this country. To change the situation of global warming, not only the people but also the policymaker and government should work together, and the turning point probably will come soon.
<br><Hr>
I empathize with your exasperated reaction to the film. It is truly infuriating to actually witness politicians play from a certain angle to gain approval when they trivialize such an important issue that affects everyone. Climate change should definitely not be a political issue which the parties utilize to push their personal agenda. It is unfathomable that politicians blame the opposing party or frame data without the whole context as a means to manipulate the public into believing and favoring them. An example is the climate-gate scandal that dramatically shifted the public’s opinion of the credibility of climate change. Without the context of the emails, politicians were able to make all the facts and statistics of climate change by scientists seem like a complete hoax. The politicians’ role in turning the public away from combating climate change in completely unacceptable. On the contrary, climate change should be a political issue in which all parties recognize and make changes in the law to combat it. The times of only looking at profit and one’s own gain is over because if changes are not made, monetary and status gains will end up being worthless.
<br><Hr>
I couldn’t agree with you more. There are no such frustrating documentaries like “Climate of Doubt” to watch. The filmmaker describes the situation of our climate crisis from the political angle, by which I could see the problem more comprehensively. Other than the type of documentaries sadly depicting how our planet is in the crunch time because of the climate crisis, “Climate of Doubt” showcases a variety of problems taking place around us and expresses concerns through the words of politicians, physicists, and environmentalists. 
<br><br>


I totally fell into a rage after watching Fred Singer, who was a retired physicist presenting a speech at the climate-crisis conference, state that “There’s nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It’ll get colder. It’ll get warmer. We just have to wait a little”. I was totally speechless and frustrated. How could a knowledgable man like him say words like these? In other words, he wants us all to wait for the planet itself to self-recover. How absurd this statement was…After a moment of thinking, I realized that he was just in a denial of accepting the fact and skeptics like him had been doubting the real situation. Myron Ebell’s response towards the questioning of climate scientists’ credibilities is also frustrating to me. Politicians are abusing their positions and power to maximize their profits and risking others’ lives simultaneously without considering the overall influence on the planet.

<br><br>

Overall, this is a great documentary informing and awakening the audience that climate change is real and we should go ahead and take action.

This film has answered a lot of my questions regarding why people ever doubted climate change in the first place. I have always wondered why climate change was even a political issue in the first place. To me, climate change is something that is backed by scientific evidence and should not even be a political issue or something that needs to be debated as 98% of scientists have provided proof of this. In the film the climate doubters provide “reasoning” as to why they agree with the 2% of the scientists who refute climate change and honestly doesn't even seem reasonable. In my eyes, they seem quite greedy and only concerned about “taxes” and seem to disregard the issue in order to benefit them fiscally. The reporter who said that most of the politicians ignored her questions regarding climate change only assures the fact that they don’t have the proper evidence to back up their claim. The politicians who are climate doubters had built a supporting audience based on fallacies and many followed their favorite leaders as a source of comfort regardless of real evidence. Additionally, the fact that one the biggest climate change doubters was the same man who refuted the belief humans were the cause of acid rain, the ozone layer depletion and the fact that second-hand smoke did not even cause health problems causes a lot of suspicion whether this source should even be considered reliable. In conclusion, this film helped clear a lot of questions on why climate change is a political issue in the first place and I think everyone should watch this film no matter your political party.

Merchants of Doubt is an eye-opening film, it pointed out that by bringing uncertainty like we are not sure if tobacco really cause cancer, and we are not sure what really cause global warming, those doubts in mind will cause a delay for us to start putting in actions against climate change, it will negatively impact our motivations because we are now doubting climate change. I also watched A Climate of Doubt, I think this film is an informative and revealing film that introduces the aspect of global warming skeptics and the impacts of their misinformation. One of the strategies they use to misleading people is very impressive to me, which is called  “going down the up escalator, ” where it shows that climate is declining in every small part but it is actually increasing overall. It is surprising to me that some people really think human activities did not have any impact on climate change and part of them are educated people, I can’t agree with them especially after watching the film from last week. Apparently, our environment is getting worse and it is putting ourselves on risk if we don’t do anything and just let it be. After watching this film, I’m not convinced by their point of view, I feel like they don’t have strong scientific evidence. I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t take it seriously and protect our own environment.

In one of my past comments I briefly talk about the immorality of fossil fuel corporations. It has been exposed on multiple occasions that many fossil fuel extractors, like big oil corporations, are well aware of the environmental impact of their operations and they still continue to operate and expand. After watching Merchants of Doubt, I am even more sure of this, and I am disgusted by these corporations that continue to devastate our atmosphere and climate by spreading seeds of doubt throughout the public and government. As long as they have scientists willing to dispute largely indisputable evidence pointing to climate change, I worry that it will delay the extent of the larger public’s awareness to the point where we can’t reverse the effects. 
<br><br>


I found the analogy between magic and major corporations’ tactics to deny their role in anything negative, such as climate change, to be very interesting. The movie talks about large tobacco companies going to public relations firms to respond to a rising concern of the adverse health effects of cigarettes. The PR firm tells them that with all the evidence collected pointing to this being true that they couldn’t argue against it, but what they could do is cast doubt on that evidence. Shifting the focus or the blame of the issue to something that engages the public more, makes it easier for fossil fuels to get away with continued exploitation of our Earth.

Climate change has always been a widely talked about issue my whole life. I don’t think I have ever met anyone that does not believe or at least acknowledge that climate change is a real issue. The film “Climate of A Doubt” introduced me to a different perspective in which climate change is somewhat of a political scheme and an exaggeration. For one, it was good to see another perspective than the one I’m surrounded by. One thing the film focuses on is a summit that is being held in Chicago in  an attempt to disprove man-made global climate change. As the film mentions, these skeptics think of themselves as “rebels.” As I heard more of the speakers talk about how they didn’t believe in anthropogenic climate change, It angered me. One quote that stuck with me was one of the speakers saying that climate change is inevitable and it will eventually fix itself because it is a natural process. I think it is really easy to have that mindset when we aren’t being directly  affected by it. But as I’ve learned, whole islands and regions are being flooded because of rising sea levels, droughts and lack of resources  are affecting millions of people, and people are losing their cultures and lifestyles. 
<br><br>
	Although I felt angered by their unpopular opinions, I also understood why they felt driven to rebel against the popular opinion. Their goal is to change American’s perspective on climate change, even going as far as the American Tradition Institute  requesting emails to find evidence of corruption. Myron Ebell, who is against the idea of climate change, pointed out in the film that a lot of their supporters are actual people who “get their hands dirty”, people from the heartland. For a lot of these people, accepting anthropogenic climate change, means changing their lifestyle drastically and spending more money. The situation has become a political and economic fight between both sides. Even some of us who do acknowledge anthropogenic climate change refuse to do our part or ignore the harsh reality of the situation because it is a change of lifestyle. At this point, it is time to make a choice to prevent the worst from happening to the planet. It is not about politics or money. It’s about saving the planet and saving millions of  lives.

After watching “Climate of Doubt” I was well informed from what I saw that the fight for climate change is not only science-related but also a political issue. Many of these climate skeptics are political leaders that do not believe that climate change exists or that it is because of human related actions, and many of the skeptics are funded by oil companies which explains why they do not want to believe in it because a big source of their income is what is causing climate change. An example was the chairman who said that it was a big problem, but then when he became chairman, he became a skeptic. How can someone just stop believing in climate change that quickly? 
<br><br>
Another thing that frustrated me was that the skeptic's evidence for their argument was not reliable or valid. For example, the Oregon petition, which was ⅓ scientist but there were also celebrities and rich people who signed. In addition, they were trying to gain evidence for their argument by trying to sabotage the other side, for example, the “climate gate emails” and rather than having real scientific evidence with numbers and dates they felt that by these emails their argument would be valid. Also, they tried to manipulate the data to show there was a cooling. Overall, most of their evidence did not make sense to me as to why they so strongly believe climate change is not real.

You say "it's not only a science-related issue but also a political issue".  I would disagree and say it is only a political issue.  Science is on climate change's side.  We have all but proven climate change is real.  At this point we are at a time where the only debate on climate change is that if it is worth it for the economy to impose new taxes and regulations.  While some may use bad science to offer reasoning to avoid new climate policies, any real decision-maker is more concerned about their electability and campaign funds.  While I watched Climate of Doubt, in Merchant of Doubt,Bob Inglis, a former congressman from South Carolina shifted his view point from a climate change skeptic to a climate change believer.  Unfortunately this led him to losing his spot in congress due to his competitor getting funding from oil companies, and a large distaste for climate change in  conservative America. 

<br><br>

I also am frustrated with the lack of logic climate change deniers use.  Throughout the whole film examples of false statements, or facts taken out of context are on display.  I also agree that it is annoying to see climate change deniers create fake controversies such as "climate-gate" instead of finding valid facts to support their beliefs.

I was shocked by the amount of false information and ignorance that was discussed by the politicians in “A Climate of Doubt”. The authors of this book and those who endorse its messages choose to ignore the real life consequences of the climate crisis that is happening right now. They degrate scientists and policy makers who wish to reform fossil fuel companies activities so that global temperatures do not rise to more than 2 degrees celsius. They are against keeping fossil fuels where they belong, deep underground, in order for them to be extracted and become a source of extreme wealth for them. This is why they choose to ignore the climate issue as an urgent matter but this extremely problematic because the more time we continue to debate the existence of climate change, the less time we have to reverse the warming. How many more people, ecosystems, animals, and natural resources must die before people can finally open their eyes? I nearly cried when I heard politician, Christopher Monckton say “The right response to the non problem of global warming is to have the courage to do nothing.” I completely disagree with this statement, in fact I believe it's the cowards way out. To refuse to do anything about the disasters occurring RIGHT NOW all in the name of money is the reason why I despise these so called experts and politicians. They are not helping us, they’re simply dragging us further into the abyss.

“Merchant of Doubt” is an eye opening and interesting film that allows us to take a peek at the minds of climate crisis deniers and how the selfishness of many million dollar companies crosses paths with the reality of factual data. The film discusses how smoking used to happen everywhere and anywhere, such as in restaurants, workplaces, hospitals, etc. The film presents all the propaganda related to Tobacco and Nicotine companies. In the 50s, scientists started to figure out the dangers of cigarettes and told individuals that tobacco causes cancer. But, the CEO’s of all big tobacco companies told congress under oath that nicotine was not addictive and does not cause cancer. Later, these deniers started to create statements and ads stating, “Cigarettes may be hazardous or may not be” which causes doubt within the minds of their consumers. This idea of causes doubt successfully worked so other businesses that are facing similar regulatory challenge decided it would be best to use this tactic as well in order to make their profit rise significantly. More than 1/2 million Americans a year have died due to tobacco related issues yet these business still launched. Even to this day the nicotine and tobacco companies have found other tactics in order to keep their business up and running. They have created different designs, flavors and electric devices in many different colors to appeal a wide variety of individuals - especially the youth. Even when the dangers of Tobacco finally was proven to be real, the companies still refused to take responsibility. Cigarettes can burn for up to 30 minutes after use which caused many deaths due to fires. The companies were in denial and blame in on the furniture companies. They did not even try to make a self burnout cigarette because they did not want to alter a product that is making them billions a year. “The furniture was to blame - fireproof the world from the cigarettes and needed a third party to deliver message.” This is exactly how they are making a profit. Furniture companies ended up using pounds of toxic chemicals to create non flammable  furniture as their scapegoat for fire-related deaths.
<br><br>

This is exactly what climate crisis deniers are doing because they are making money from these major fossil fuel companies. Even though it was proven that greenhouse gasses has affected our earth which was why Venus turned 600 degrees. Once the scientist realized our climate was changing there was a huge denial of scientific facts. Scientist explained how the Co2 we put in the air will stay in the climate system for a millennial which puts a blanket around the planet that holds in extreme heat. Denier backfired by putting out ads stating, “More Pollution Will be Good for Us” and “Warmer is Better.” These types of individuals and selfish//greedy company owners who refuse to change, refuse to shift and continue to try and convince us that global warming is normal and good for us are the individuals who won’t see the direct effects. They simply do not care that the climate crisis is manmade and catastrophic. Overall, I truly enjoyed this film and would recommend to my family and friends.

I watched "Merchants of Doubt" as well. As you did, I also found it interesting to learn about the history of public opinion on the cigarette and tobacco industry. We've grown up in a time where the dangerous consequences of cigarettes are widespread knowledge, and I think we sometimes forget that for most of history people were not aware of the potential dangers of smoking. And even when scientists began to figure out the dangers, such as cancer, the cigarette companies made sure that the public did not trust the new conclusions, by working to sow doubt through advertising and denial. It also frustrated me to learn how the cigarette companies blamed furniture for the fires that their product was causing, which resulted in furniture companies having to use toxic and dangerous chemicals.
<br><br>

It was interesting and eye-opening how the film connected the history of public opinion on the cigarette industry to the modern day climate change discussion. The same tactics are being used by climate change deniers and fossil fuel companies to influence public opinion and policy. They are attempting to incite doubt or skepticism about the scientific consensus, and it can be a fairly effective strategy, yet can be very dangerous, as seen in the history of the cigarette industry. In all, I thought the film approached the issue of climate change denial, public opinion, and policy from an interesting angle by looking into the rhetorical strategies of climate change deniers.

This film was honestly my least favorite so far everything these Anti-climate change lobbyists were saying has literally been proven wrong. Climate change is happening, and it is man-made. At the beginning of the film I was very confused on why they so strongly believed made climate change was not a thing, there have been studies of the ocean levels rising, acid rain, the rise of greenhouse gases in our ozone layer causing the ocean temperatures to rise and killing off 1000 of species, but then it hit me a lot of these people support or have worked at places that want to use up the earth’s natural resources such as oil, so they try so hard to convince others that climate change isn’t happening so they can run our earth into the ground. A lot of these anti climate change supporters’ facts were only based off things that clearly showed climate change was happening. For example, the graphs that they claimed to show “global cooling” was in intact all global warming with a part where the when aye was cold. I was honestly extremely shocked to hear all these different viewpoints of how climate change wasn’t real and it’s fake, mainly because growing up in California I wasn’t exposed to a lot of conservative view points but either way I don’t agree with them at all and I feel like this younger generation, my generation, is more aware of the global impact of climate change and will actually make a difference.

I definitely share your shock from watching “A Climate of Doubt” because we’ve been surrounded by a majority of people who believe in climate change. It didn’t occur to me that there are still so many people who are adamant in the denial of its existence. As you explained, I can see why there is still a considerable amount of people who doubt climate change. They think they can save their jobs and their lifestyle by denying human-caused climate change, but it’s beyond selfish to spread false messages and stubbornly refuse to preserve our planet. Countless new jobs will pop up if we could turn away from fossil fuel industries such as coal mining, and I think it’s critical that people realize that.

There is always a hidden perspective in life especially within issues that arise in life. It was really interesting seeing the dynamic relationship between alarmists and denialists on the topic of environmental issues such as the tobacco industry or chemicals like flame retardants. This opened my eyes to the underlying truths that people tend to hide especially when they are the cause of the problem such as the tobacco industry with cigarettes and cancer causing chemicals. Many people did not know this fact until 1960’s and it was just shocking how companies will be willing to hide certain truths just for financial benefits. These same corrupt companies would then also hire people with money into industries like oil, coal, or firefighting to spread the word of safety in their products. This exposure lead me to rethink the credibility of denialists as they tend to create their own data instead of basing it on statistical data like scientists do. In one part of the film, it shows how the non-believers copied the IPCC’s manual for their conference with formatting and rewrote their own data into it. The film additionally introduces magicians in relationships to the greenhouse benefactors on how they are able to hide the truth through misdirection and tricking the brain into thinking environmental issues are not human caused or that there is something like beneficial warming. The denialists sound fake cause they do address the issue of these problems but do not have credible sources to explain their testaments even in court.

I noticed in this film that “I can’t predict the percentage of man-made climate change” and “I would be sorry”. If so, why there is no one appeal people to do something and just watching billions of people losing their homes? Indeed, the percentage is hard to predict, but everyone knows too much industrialization release without purifying has definitely caused global warming partially. It is true most of us living in a relatively good condition right now, but what about poorer people? And what about people whose homes are on island or nearby coast lines with rising sea level? Although there is only political consensus right now, it is true human should do something to revise at present instead of waiting for a scientific consensus. The hottest years are 2016-2019, which means temperature began to rise after fossil fuels are commonly used too much. Decades ago, why was there no sign of global warming when only a few countries are industrialized? If no action will be taken, climate change could be irreversible.

In the movie, “Merchants of Doubt”, I was instantly riveted by the filmmakers introduction, which was of a magician showing his magic tricks and explaining how he, as a magician, tricks people (with their knowledge) but he gets upset when people take his trade and use it to dishonestly trick people. I thought this was an interesting way to introduce the subject of how tobacco companies knew about the fact that cigarette smoking can cause cancer but decided to keep this information from the public just so that they could still make a lot of profits from the sale of cigarettes. I didn’t see it before, but now thinking back on it, a lot of these companies that are making products which are bad for humans, animals, and/or our planet really do act like dishonest, immoral magicians. They conceal from us, their audience, what they know to be true and tie it up with pretty packaging to convince us that they can be trusted. They believe they can’t be hurt because they hold all the power, they hold all of us captive with a show, whilst dirty deeds are done behind our backs. It’s just sickening to even think about.
<br><br>

I was also really interested in Morano’s section of the film because he is aware of the fact that many scientists are not very good orators or communicators (meaning that it is hard for them to connect with their audiences). He, on the other hand, is very good at communicating his thoughts with the public and he takes advantage of the fact that scientists in general really aren’t as good at this. This was seen in his debate with Bill Nye about global warming in which you can see that Morano genuinely enjoys arguing with people.  Rather than telling the truth about the situation, he prefers to essentially fight back and forth with scientists to make them seem less credible in the eyes of the public. Unfortunately, for the people who aren’t very aware about the truth of the situation (in this case, global warming) it would be very easy to side with Morano due to his dominating nature in the debate. To Morano, this is all just a game, a game that he enjoys winning at. But to all humans, this is serious. This is life or death. We have to see the concrete facts of the climate crisis and change our ways.

The documentary “A climate of Doubt’ by the Frontier is an objective type of source that really stands out to me by presenting evidence and interviewees concerning the “Heartland Institute” and its campaign on denying anthropogenic climate crisis. The multiple interviews in this film really makes me laugh while I was watching. First, the things that these scientists or politicians said are based on nothing. Essentially all things they’ve be talking about is how wrong it is for policymakers to actually engage in actions that mitigate climate crisis and how costly these projects are. Plus, even if the data they presented in the meetings which seems reliable and convincing are flawed. One thing that really makes me laugh is the data from Heartland Institue that the temperature is decreasing. While the data taken only from a 10 year period proves that the temperature is decreasing, the bigger picture does not prove so. If you look at the data from a 100-year scale, one could easily see how the temperature has risen. However, there seem no responses to such a fallacious interpretation of data from the Heartland Institute. 

<br><br>

It is also worrisome that one politician involved in this campaign called climate crisis “bs” and a lot of people agree on that. After watching the film, I feel like the whole thing of debate is on politics, it is really just a political debate for some sorts of “profit”. And the approaches taken by some of the fossil fuel companies are ridiculously undefendable, e.g to defend the argument not through politics but through science. We don’t even care if there is a consensus or not, the data is telling all the things. And it is even more to my surprise that the legislators of some conservative states reject actions to mitigate environmental catastrophes that are already taking places, e.g the North Carolina seal-level rise.

Before watching "A Climate of Doubt," I was well aware that most GOP lawmakers were generally very much against the idea that climate change is anthropogenic, however I did not know the extent to which they would go to in order to make themselves look like a credible source and/or figure. The fact that Republicans will simply state that climate change is “a part of life” greatly concerns me and gives me little to no hope that we will be able to prevent and minimize further damage to our planet. As mentioned in the film, it is even more concerning that within the span of four years, “the number of Americans who agree global warming is man-made has dropped by about half.” It is mind-boggling that people can be oblivious about the damage man-kind has done to our planet even when the evidence presents itself upon their faces; even with notable mass extinctions of certain animal and plant species, with record-breaking temperatures, and even with estimated rising sea levels, many still refuse to believe that climate change exists! Evidently enough, if no effort is soon put into ending climate change and reversing the many dangerous effects it has had on our planet, future generations will not live to even argue about its existence. Tampering with evidence will do no good if it leads to further environmental damage and if it still persists to threaten the survival of our species and other living species world-wide.

The situation is severer now. Many people become homeless due to the climate change. It seems that for now we cannot live without the use of fossil fuel.  It is true that the reduction of the use of fossil fuel will cause the decrease of the profits. The documentary, “A Climate of Doubt”, criticize the climate crisis skeptics. It focuses on what are the opinions of these skeptics. It is really useful in the education process to learn about what skeptics are think of , and why they have such thoughts. As a result, we could have a better understanding of climate crisis.



</p><hr>


<p>
From the movie, we can tell that there was a major shift in people's concerns about global warming. And global warming is closely related to politics is what the documentary has shown to the audience. I think that politicians change their speeches with the shift of the people, and they simply can get votes. The documentary presents the hypocritical side of politics. And skeptics were spread quickly among people. Some people just believe those ideologies without getting to know them well.

<br><br>

The protests for  "cap-and-trade"  was shocking to me. It is reasonable that people do not want to pay more taxes. But it can not be the reason to deny Global Warming. People were blindly followed by the deniers and they did not actually get to the problem behind. The government should come out with more efficient solutions to solve the climate crisis instead of directly taxing the people. Also, people should think thoroughly,  and not just be driven by their own benefits. It is still sustainable for our generation to live on this planet now, but now one can guarantee the future of this planet for humans. Only humans to act can possibly change the problems that exist.
<br><br>


The film was created eight years ago, but now when we look at it that humans have suffered a lot in the eight-year time frame. The wildfires, the tsunami, the drought, and the abnormal weather. Those are the real events that we have experienced in the past eight years. And in the end that the documentary mentions about the sea level rise in South Carolina. Now, the sea level does rise globally. People, nowadays, not just hear about the sea level rise will destroy a town in South Carolina --- it is it might take down the whole country of Japan, Maldives (Island countries). Probably there was not enough proof, but we have multiple shreds of evidence now.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the whole movie, I felt very confused about climate change skeptics’ view. One of the main points of this movie is arguing whether humans are the primary factor in climate change. Without a doubt, the answer for me is definitely yes. It does not affect my opinion on climate change.  However, it’s quite surprising for me that there is a group of people stands out and suspicious of climate change. They try to convince the public that climate change is a political conspiracy. The government just wants to collect more taxes from people. I felt very angry when I saw the scene. Especially, when they were asked what if they wrong, they just responded sorry as the answer. As I think, they are just a group of people controlled by fossil fuel owners. So they can get more benefits from people and government. We can actually tell how serious climate change is just by watching the news every day.  In real life, we can also see the tornado in America become stronger and more frequent recently. We should feel alarmed. Those are the things we should really worry about instead of spreading fake news about climate change. Protecting the Earth is everyone’s responsibility.

I agree, I also don’t understand how climate change skeptics rationalize their view of climate change. I think the reason why it is so confusing and frustrating, is because it unquestionably goes against scientific fact and scientific consensus. It is scientific fact that climate change is anthropogenic, yet climate deniers try to convince the public otherwise. In regard to public opinion on climate change, it’s important to understand the amount of influence the fossil fuel industry has on American politics and its economy. I think that is the reason why climate deniers try to make climate change a political conspiracy. To accept the realities of climate change would destroy the fossil fuel industry and the country’s reliance on oil. The industries that have destroyed our environment deny climate change because they know they would be destroyed if climate change was politically accepted. Because of this, these industries finesse and entangle themselves within American politics, political leaders, and policymaking. By lobbying within politics, these industries are able to influence and manipulate public opinion through our elected political leaders. The spread of climate denial and fake news is an example of how our politics align to the organizations that fund our political leaders. This is why Ken, in last week’s video, was emphasizing the importance of voting. Climate change is real, it is scientific fact. It is a collective and universal crisis. The topic of climate change has no place for debate. We need to vote for political leaders who represent the demand of the people. We need to understand the that fragility of our democracy resembles the fragility of our Earth.

After watching the movie, A Climate of Doubt, I really don't know what to say. As mentioned in Ken's lecture, many fossil fuel companies control public opinion and cover up the truth in order to earn money. What saddens me most is that there are still people or even scientists who think that environmental problems are just words that scientists are manipulated to say. Maybe they are the ones who were being manipulated. Who knows? It's really hard to imagine how much money the people who are well educated have received to say such ignorant words. Shame on them.
<br><br>


I like a student's comment and I quote here, “I just wonder, what do they want to do with all this money if the earth will be destroyed in the next coming decades because of their actions?” When there is no a drop of clean water, a breath of clean air, and a part of clean land on the earth, what can they do with this money? Travel around the world? Arctic and Antarctic would be a good place to have clean breath. Or the desert, maybe. Give them to the family? There will be no human because of the uninhabitable world. The most upset part is that they can't even buy a clean cemetery. In the end, they can burn that money as fuels and end their life which full of sin.

<p>
I honestly can’t believe how arrogant those climate change deniers were in the video. They’re so sure of themselves without transparent and honest science to back them. I think it’s a pretty dangerous combination when you combine arrogance with their mentality. That Fred Singer guy was almost laughing when he was saying he was right and 97-98% of other scientists were wrong. Also when he started saying secondhand smoke wasn’t really a danger he had this smirk almost as if he knew he was full of shit but he seems to like playing the contrarian. There seems to be little to no constructive conversation with these type of people. It’s really unfortunate because they actually affect people with their stances and the more people we have a country that are trying to play contrarian and/or rebel is only prolonging the time before we have real policies in place to help combat the climate crisis.
<br><br>
I also found it pretty sad that because of them and of “climategate”, the two main political figures in 2012(Obama and Romney) steered clear of the issue of global warming. It’s just disheartening that we couldn’t talk about the facts because so much of it became politicized. And when things get politicized we tend to make little to no progress on actual issues. My only hope is that the majority of people see through the game they play and realize there are more important things than which side is “right”. And hopefully they act now before it’s truly too late.

For me, I've never been into politics like many other people. I would say that I'm very uneducated in that field. But after watching "A Climate of Doubt", I can see just how ignorant some of our world leaders can be. People like Myron Ebell who don't care about the consequences of global warming and just simply replied with "I would be sorry" in the case that global warming was a real thing. It's unfathomable how unsympathetic some people can be. They know that in their lifetime they won't be as affected. They know that they can profit from denying the truth about climate change. The documentary even goes to mention that Barack Obama rarely ever mentioned anything about climate change except in his speech where he grazes over it.

<p>
This documentary made me SO MAD. Using our planet's future as a cheap political tool is so sickening. Politicians really do not know what they're talking about when it comes to this stuff, and it's so tiring. We need either support from politicians or mass public reaction to fix this issue, and the people like Myron Ebell know that. This debate does not matter to him any more than any other bureaucratic stunt he pulls. He would be sorry if he were wrong? Millions of people would be dead, and our planet destroyed beyond repair. It's time to start apologizing, man.
<br><br>
I often wonder what the world would be like if politicians actually worked to listen to and care about the public opinion, and acted like civil servants instead of greedy pigs who would sabotage anyone for a dime. I find it very ironic that American propaganda has slammed communism forever because those in power could hog all the wealth and leave people starving and dying. Isn't that like..... exactly what's happening here? Our world is run by a power-blind aristocracy.

The film, "Climate of Doubt" brings to light all the climate skeptics. One of the main lines that really caught my attention in the film was, "... accuse my colleagues of me of treason against the Earth." said by, congressman James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin. It's not so much treason, but more ignorance against the Earth. To think climate change is not happening is pretty messed up. I understand in politics once one picks a side they have to stand by it, but that's the problem now. We have become too divided and spend too much time arguing who's right and who's wrong, when we should be working on a solution.

It is really sad and depressed to see in the movie "A Climate of Doubt and Merchant of Doubt" that there are so many climate crisis we caused that need to be suffered by a lot of people. As only a small amount of the world population, we caused the major problem on the Earth, thus some people have to move away from their origins, have to starve, and some non-human lives extinct. 
<br><br>

Of course, saying words such as the world will get better by itself, and the problems will be automatically fixed is such an irresponsible thought. Nothing cannot fix perfectly after we break it, so does the environment. Also it is such an irresponsible behavior to spread this thought. Even though it might not influence groups such as college students, there will certainly be some groups of people have no doubt in this sentence, which eventually will cause more problems and more damages. 
<br><br>

Despite that we have statistical evident prove the co2 emission has increased exponentially in the past several decades, majority scientists agree upon the climate change issues, no matter what, we should take action before things get too late.

When watching this I found it really interesting that some people were denying it as even being a possibility that human production is contributing to the rise in temperature of the earth. I remember a couple years back, being just like the deniers, in that humans have are not impacting the environment. An interesting point was brought up among the skeptics, that the main reason they are fighting climate change is because they believe that the government will take away freedoms from the people. As an individual that is all for individual liberties, so much so that it is the basis for most of my political decisions, I find that It would be better safe than sorry. You can’t have freedom if you don’t have a planet to inhabit. One of the spokespeople for the skeptics movement said that he really wanted to win the science debate, and that would put the nail in the coffin for climate change believers. I’m not saying that the climate change believers are one-hundred percent correct, as there are many uncertainties in this universe, but it is more likely to be true than false.

It is cool to hear that you prioritize individual liberties while also recognizing that the issue of climate change is unique because our liberties don’t matter if the planet is destroyed. I understand that people don’t want to be told what to do but I hope we can work towards seeing the necessary changes as a group effort that will benefit us all by preserving our planet. Merchants of doubt introduced a few people, like Bob Inglis, who shifted from being climate change deniers to being educators about climate change. I think this relates to your point because as time goes on people are understanding that this is the biggest issue we face. They understand how huge and real it is in ways that move them to break from their “tribe,” as described in the movie. As more people in tribes that typically deny climate change speak out and represent their tribe while also standing for the urgent climate change crisis, I think that more people will believe in climate change. I really liked this movie because it showed parallels between different doubt campaigns and this makes it easier to understand why and how people are being convinced to doubt the reality of climate change today.

The immense influence of political agenda and its control over politicians' ability to effectively combat climate change with the necessary policies is highlighted within the documentary, reflecting the greatest threat to protecting our environment. Yes, the fossil fuel corporations funding them and free think tanks are largely behind this, but it is mostly up to the American public. Civilians themselves are largely dissuaded between truth and lies that ultimately affects the politicians in charge and their willingness to take action at the expense of their position of authority. Specifically illustrated near the end of the documentary, a couple of politicians like President Obama and Mitt Romney are shown in clips to state how they believe climate change is an issue needed to be faced. However, it then transitions to clips from later times in which they are shown to be against climate change or quiet about the situation, all because of the political agenda they have and their desire to keep their ratings up. This back and forth fight essentially puts us all at a significant disadvantage to the effects of climate change as we fail to take action. Ultimately, this all lies among humans’ choice of beliefs, such as shown by the politicians in North Carolina who disbelieve in climate change and don’t want to take the necessary actions to prepare against the rising sea levels of 39 inches that will flood their town. There is an obvious disconnect between groups classified by those who believe in climate change and those who don’t. But either way, its consequences will still occur and affect all groups no matter what. I’ve noticed a consistent pattern of corporations or people combating against climate change because they believe it ultimately affects their freedom and “American way of life”, failing to consider the ultimate consequences that will affect their generation and future ones due to their ignorance and selfishness. Yes, policies regarding climate change will impact the economy one way or another, but they will be necessary and require Americans to adjust their perspective for a better future. This is where I understand that Americans believe that the freedom instilled to them by this Constitution is endangered, but the policies enacted wouldn’t be radical to change their lives for the worse. Rather, through evidence-based teaching and correction, communities must come to an understanding of the threat the planet faces instead of believing it to be indoctrination.

I like how the film shows clips from tobacco industry propaganda. These people argued that cigarette smoking doesn't kill people; they said it’s a myth because there’s no consensus. Crazy! It’s the same technique that was used against climate change! There is so much deception in society with people and their agendas. It surfaced that the tobacco companies knew about everything they had been denying, yet took no responsibility for it.
<br><br>

The biggest thing I took from Merchants of Doubt is that to satisfy political agendas, people cast doubt more than flat out deny things. I also noticed this in the book. According to “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change,” The book was constantly saying that climate change may or may not be happening. This is how they were casting doubt. Although I pointed it out in my comment in response to the book, I didn't even realize exactly what they were doing until the film pointed it out.
<br><br>

The motivation behind casting doubt is delaying policies so the companies can make more money. Tobacco started it for other industries, and the denying techniques were passed down. To flame retardants, and now climate change.
<br><br>

There actually has been a consensus of global climate change. The data is real. People just ignore this data because for the sake of politics.

After watching the film, “A Climate of Doubt,” I was really upset with what Myron Ebell said in response to being asked what if you’re (climate skeptics) were wrong. All he had to say for himself was that he would be “Sorry.” His response showed no signs of remorse and lacked any sort of empathy to those who would be affected by his mistake. For those who have or will lose everything as a result of inaction and the denial of climate change, “sorry,” is just an empty word. It means nothing. It will not undo the consequences of his actions. It will not fix the problem caused by climate deniers. Saying “sorry,” just doesn’t cut it for the millions of people that will suffer because of climate change.

<br><br>

I find it ironic how climate deniers accuse scientists of taking bribes and altering their data to support the existence of climate change. And because of that, climate deniers believe that climate change is a hoax. Yet, climate deniers get a majority of their funding from those who are invested in the fossil fuel industry. This makes it hard for me to see how anyone could believe that climate change is a hoax. Those who are invested in the fossil fuel industry are more concerned about their financial gains rather than the well-bring of the environment. Additionally, climate deniers are only taking portions of data that scientists come up with to fit their beliefs. As mentioned in the film, anyone can take certain data points to support their claims. For example, if you only look at global temperatures for say a 10-year period, it will show a slight cooling of temperatures. However, if you look at the data as a whole, spread over decades of data, you can see that, yes temperature is cooling over a small period, but the overall temperature is warming. This is what scientists refer to as “going up the down escalator.” If you look at all the data, it is clear that temperature is warming.
<br><br>


The one thing that I really liked about this film was when Bob Ingils used the analogy of a sick child and doing what 98 doctors say vs what 2 doctors say to describe the issue of climate change. I admire his courage for going against popular belief among his fellow Republicans that climate change is a hoax. He held firm in his belief about climate change, even though he lost his reelection as a result of it.

This film was very good and eye-opening to me. As someone who is a firm believer of climate change it allowed me to see that other side. I agree, towards the end of the film, John Hockenberry asks one of the scientists against climate change what would he do if he was wrong and he said he would apologize. This was one of the most frustrating parts in the film. It is interesting to see that although this scientist has been trying to change people's minds for song long he thinks a simple apology would suffice after all the damage his false propaganda has done. The was that his claims are most likely funded by the fossil fuel industry is even more infuriating. 

<br><br>

Watching very non-credible scientists argue against climate change made me realize that many people blindly believe these scientists because they fear the unknown that is climate change. It was mind-blowing to see that people were believing a scientist who had once made arguments against second hand smoke. Another moment that really stood out to me was when the scientist in North Carolina who was trying to get legislation passed to account for sea level rises said that even if he "loses" the battle of legislation, the ocean would tell the truth. The climate is going to keep hurting unless we do something about it and as an American it is so hard to rely on our representatives and senators who are just taking money and making claims instead of listening to their constituents.

The fact that these major fossil fuel companies and climate change deniers merely deny the climate crisis and its effects in order to continue making money and building their companies/wealth off of fossil fuels and other deadly resources is unreal. Their main goals are only to mislead the public and try to convince them that there is no reason to be alarmed about the issue in order for them to continue extracting the dangerous fossil fuels that contribute so much to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>


I agree with you in that these people have no sign of remorse towards those who will be affected by their horrible actions on our planet. Their main priority is to expand their wealth and continue to live their comfortable and extravagant lifestyles. The lack of empathy and just degrading actions and ways of thinking that these people have are the reason why we will most likely have no future on this earth and the climate crisis will eventually become irreversible. They do not care about the harmful effects because they will either be dead by the time the most dangerous events will take place, or they believe that the money they have will somehow protect them and they will be the last to be affected.
<br><Hr>


I really liked your second paragraph because I think it really highlights how weak the arguments against climate change really are. A lot of skeptics use what any real scientist would consider to be straight up nonsensical data analysis. You can't look at a brief time window where the temperature  goes down towards the end relative to the average in that window and draw conclusions from that. Most real arguments proving temperature rises are based around concrete data that temperatures are getting higher and at greater frequencies than ever before and span many decades. Instead deniers just cherry pick data that goes with their argument.
<br><br>


This reminded me of the time in class where the professor explained how temperatures varied over the 12month year and that deniers would point at the cyclic decreases as proof that climate change was fabricated. People will really get lazy and use whatever anecdotal evidence they have to avoid facing reality.

<br><Hr>
I was also very disappointed with Myron Ebell's response to the question "what if you are wrong". His simple response of "I'm Sorry" was very ungenuine and unforgiving. I believe he has no intention of apologizing because he understands that as a senior citizen he will not live long enough for his argument to be proven faux.
<br><br>
As for your point on climate deniers and their shady research methods, I think a great point was made in class last Wednesday; If there is not enough research to prove climate change exists how can there be enough research to prove that it does not. What is the harm of consuming less, having fewer children, and living healthier lives? The simple truth is there is no harm, with solar and wind power becoming just as cheap as fossil fuels the only thing holding us back from serious change is the money and power held by the fossil fuel industry. This film did an excellent job shedding light on this open agenda so many refuse to see. Like you said its time to listen to the majority of climate scientists rather than the few who tell us everything will be alright.

“Climate of Doubt” by PBS shows exactly how big fossil fuel companies were able to control the discussion of climate change through the media and the public. In the video, it states how climate change was one of the main issues in 2008 for politicians, but in 2012 when people should’ve been caring more, it was barely a political issue and barely mentioned in the race. The fact that fossil fuel companies were able to manipulate the information this way, shocked me at first but the more I thought about it, the more I realized how doable it is. It makes sense that they dedicate unlimited funds to manipulating the public because they will lose so much money if legislation has been made. The fact that they care so much about this money, when they know about the truth of what will happen in the future with no action about climate change, is so concerning to me. The fossil fuels companies selfishness amazes me, and when climate change deniers realize this, it will be too late.
<br><br>

 Through the many interviews on this documentary, I really got a view of how fossil fuel used their political and misinformation tactics to sway the public on their views about the climate crisis. After I watched this, all I can really do is hope that the fossil fuel companies see the weight of what they are doing soon, before it’s way too late. I just wonder, what do they want to do with all this money if the earth will be destroyed in the next coming decades because of their actions?

I find it very frustrating how politized climate change has become. Throughout the whole video there wasn’t any evidence shown to refute climate change. Climate change skeptics just repeatedly say it is a hoax and that the data is overstated. The video also mentions how they are able to manipulate data by picking specific dates to compare temperature rises or declines. It is incredible how deluded some are when flat out denying it despite evidence out there for all to see stating otherwise. 

<br><br>

For me I feel they do not even believe what they are saying. They have agendas that they want to fulfill and climate change legislation probably hurts their agendas. That is why they work tirelessly to refute climate change. Fossil fuel companies do not care about the future of the planet. They selfishly probably think it is a problem for future generations to worry about. All they want to do is make as much money as they can.

In the documentary “A Climate of Doubt,” it was sickening to watch how parties and organizations funded by corporates are trying so hard to confuse the general public by manipulating scientific data, possibly bribing scientists who were willing to sell their credentials, and cover the truth of climate change during times of economic recession. Although I was mostly disappointed while watching the documentary, it helped me to see the other side of the debate and how exactly they function and still be able to get the support when the statistics of climate change are almost concrete. I was never truly aware of how climate change has become such a political and greed issue until now, and I think it is in our best interests to educate ourselves about the subject and those around us. As professor Ken has brought up an important point of how there will be severe consequences whenever public opinions sway: people will doubt the validity of climate change and will less likely to make changes in their lives that benefit the efforts of combating climate change. At the moment, the severity of the issue make individual actions extremely crucial, from changing diet to voting for someone who aims to reduce emissions, those parties against climate change gain by confusing people so that the public becomes idle and progress is subsided.

It also makes me angry that the topic of climate change is a political issue when it should not be there are many politicians who are against climate change because they do not want to lose millions of dollars. Our own president has done many things to show that he clearly does not believe or care about the effects of climate change. When you are sick with a cold, you go to the doctors. When your tooth aches you go to the dentist. When you have a question about climate change listen to what the scientist says…. Scientist say climate change is real so believe them, they have studied this for many years. Especially when 97% of scientists believe in climate change the evidence is there however politicians are simply too greedy and will always want anything that benefits them. It is sad to see how money can even affect politicians who are supposed to be doing the best for this country. They are doing what is best for them.    
 <br><br>

Many people were misled with information regarding the health concerns about the use of cigarettes. Doctors were hired to say that there is no known harm that cigarettes can give you and that there was no correlation between smoking and cancer. Oil companies have also hire5d scientists to say that climate change is not happening or in fact even fake.

The first thing I wanted to comment on regarding this movie is how homogenous the demographics of climate deniers and spokespeople is. Nearly every person interviewed on the oppositional side was an older white male. I think this is a point a lot of people will dismiss because it may not seem directly related or important to the issue the film is attempting to expose. However, I think it is maybe one of the most important elements of the climate crisis. The crisis was created because of the people who exercise their privilege and power over the planet and those who attempt to protect it, and the crisis won't be averted until we can learn, as a society, to listen to those who have been silenced: women, children, the poor, people of color. I am personally uninterested in listening to any other source at this point--because where has it gotten us? I'm listening to those are going to be affected by climate change, those who care about the future of all of the species on earth and their own children. People like Greta and AOC who have been famously "discredited" due to "belonging in school" or as a "pre-school teacher." It's time for us to face the real roots of the issue--it's not just that the people in power are holding on to their money and companies. They are holding on to their privilege over oppressed groups. 
 <br><br>

Secondly, we talked in lecture about AOC being called out for driving too much/not using public transport. This film discussed the same issue with Al Gore. I think it is completely ridiculous for one to try to discredit someone's climate change activism simply because they are participate in consumer capitalism. Consumer capitalism is the enemy, but who created it? It is so absurd to blame the consumer when companies are literally putting billions of dollars into ensuring we participate. Yeah, sometimes passionate climate change activists use plastic straws or drive instead of taking the bus. This is the life we were given and the life we are trying to change. While we all can do little things to help, it's not the little things that are going to stop this. It's the take down of the big people who are yielding their immense power and platform to cause damage.

Upon finishing the "Climate of Doubt" film, I found myself in disbelief. Even when presented with reliable data, individuals like Fred Singer, still found themselves denying global warming. Not to mention another whopping 30,000+ individuals (some with Ph.Ds and celebrities, friends, etc) signed a form agreeing science is being hyped and there is no such thing as climate change. It is incredibly frustrating watching skeptics, or so called scientists, going up against accepted science when the information is undeniably factual (at least to 97% of climate scientists). Singer, an outspoken skeptic of climate change, said “Climate is a phantom issue. There is nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It will get colder, it will get warmer… we just have to wait a little.” I was baffled hearing this because there is evidence showcasing the existence of global warming over decades, yet Singer stands his ground. He believes the 97% of scientists who agree climate change is real, are deluded and that he and the other climate change skeptics are in the right. I could not help but question their motives. Do they truly believe global warming is false? Or do they have some hidden agenda? 
 <br><br>
Overall, the film gave some new insight on the power of climate change skeptics and their role in politics. I feel it is safe to say most of my generation believes in climate change/global warming, so it was useful learning about a fairly new perspective on it, although bothersome to listen at times.

Because I had previously watched ¨A Climate of Doubt¨, I watched ¨Merchants of Doubt¨ this time around. The two were rather similar as they both give an inside look at climate change deniers and offer a lot of information on what fuels the propaganda. These deniers are people who, for the most part, have the opportunity or job to expand economically or politically when their actions do not have any regard for the environment. Fossil fuel companies are a big proponent of driving the denial of climate change, and they do it with their money. They pay companies like Heartland or other interest groups that have the platform to spread the word. Even if 98 scientists are all in on climate change, the two deniers evidently have money and a position of power which allows them to do everything possible to spread the word. This is a shame because of the fact that these companies, politicians, and interest groups know how to target audiences, and they are malicious in this manner by targeting young kids with no knowledge of the subject.
 <br><br>
Another general theme of this movie was addressing the fact no matter the environmental effects and harm, government interference is of most importance. Many of the deniers mentioned are politicians or people of power, and they have such a large voice that when they publicly denounce climate change, people believe them. I think that it goes without saying that to start to truly make a change to the climate`s direction, everyone must be informed of the facts and right now that is not the case. Scientists and communicators or politicians must all come together 100% in full and inform the entire public the truth. From there, with involvement and sacrifice, we can begin to make the changes necessary.

As I was watching this film I found it very frustrating that future generations are being inspired by this type of events, where they feed each other from false statements that claim skeptical people. Politicians that argue climate change is within their agenda, seek to gain support but they don't seem to really care. Skeptical arguments are poorly supported, such as when Christopher Mockton said '' CO2 is plant food”. This film reveals how opponents of climate change pick and choose data that conveys to their arguments. They attribute climate change to natural variability patterns, it is crazy to me that they choose not to see, even though the vast majority of scientists agree about climate change.
 <br><br>
Climate change should not be linked to any political party. This is something that affects all of us, and sadly the ones with the least fault are the ones that have suffered and keep suffering the most. They literally fight scientists' arguments and claim that there is no scientific consensus, Fred Singer just shocks me and his way of viewing life. Makes society doubt the truth; and the more they continue doing this, the worse it will be for future generations. It is not about saying sorry and wishing you had done something different, it's about hearing out and looking at the real data that shows climate crisis due to man made actions. It is about using your power to do something about it before it's too late and ecosystems and communities are destroyed. It is crazy that with the new technologies and the alternatives that exist nowadays, our economy still heavily relies on fossil fuels. Thus, as long as they keep extracting our natural resources, those big oil companies will fight and support events such as the one seen in the film, to spread the unimportance and "falsehood" of climate change.
 <br><br>
Similarly, the issues that should be taken care of are just being pushed away or used as propaganda, but we do not see any real implementation of bills in our legislation that seek to decrease or regulate the release of greenhouse emissions... I can only imagine what future generations will face and how regretful politicians will feel.

After watching, "A Climate of Doubt," I became aware of how political the issue is and the lengths that tobacco, and fossil fuel companies will go to make sure that they thrive. The documentary is concerned with the skeptics of the climate crisis and dives into their viewpoint with great detail. It is extremely concerning that our government is fueled by these big companies that the political agenda is of greater importance than that of our planet. What blew me away was the fact that outspoken skeptics of the climate crisis are not even scientists themselves and pose no credibility on the issue. It really just shows how manipulative these people can be and the lack of research done by the public themselves can cause confusion and indecisiveness on the issue.    One of the most frustrating parts is when "CO2 is a good thing. It's plant food," was said. The ignorance behind their reasoning is extremely upsetting. It is insanely selfish that money is the main priority and not the longevity and health of the planet we inhabit. Sure, the fossil fuel companies and tobacco companies are making millions of dollars now but the people and planet are suffering more. As Ken said in his video if a cap were to be placed on the number of fossil fuels extracted from the earth, the companies would not like that one bit and money would be lost. Politics and these companies are so infused it is going to be hard to combat their influence on the public.

The PBS Frontline documentary, “Climate of Doubt” describes how the climate change denier movement came to power and how it has become extremely politicized. While the idea that human caused activities are causing world wide climate change has been around and accepted for years, it wasn’t really until President Obama’s election that deniers came full force. As soon as there was a push for climate related policies such as cap and trade, conservatives and others who oppose change saw this as a threat to their freedom. This causes organizations such as the Heartland Institute and other think tanks to begin attacking climate science and causing doubt. What is extremely disappointing to me is that most of these head skeptics are people that do not have a strong background in science. They just alter data and spew lies to people that are easily impressionable and gain a huge following. What's worse is that most of these skeptics are spreading this false information because they are being paid to by fossil fuel interests. As soon as this issue came to the political world and the republican party sided with the deniers, the issue became even worse.  As the video showed, as soon as the deniers gained a big enough following, any republican that agreed that climate change is real was seen as abandoning their party and left-leaning. One of the most moving parts of the video for me was when republican Bob Inglis lost the primary because he said that he believes in climate change science. He realizes that this issue shouldn’t be a left versus right problem. He just sees the science and believes what the 97% of scientists are saying. As he put it, what if someone had an illness and 97% of doctors agreed on a certain treatment while 3% of them said something else. It is a huge risk to go with the 3%. While this documentary came out 8 years ago, the issues are very much prevalent. With a Republican president currently in office, policies that need to be enacted to help battle climate change are not at the forefront of political concern. In order to help save our planet, it is vital that we have someone in office that sees climate change as the urgent issue that it is and will do something to address it.

Throughout this documentary, I could not help but wonder where are all the climate supporters in the voting polls. Throughout my life, I have never met a single hardcore climate change denier. However, when it comes to take action on climate change, we are by in large unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary. My own mother who is very liberal, outspoken about climate change, and conscious about the planet was against cap and trade. She was very much in favor of banning plastic bags and straws, has a hybrid, and does her best to recycle but when she saw the economic impact cap and trade would have on our family she quietly and shamefully backed down. I think that there is a larger, more important, front to the climate change war that we are not considering and that is an internal one. I am certain that climate change supporters vastly outnumber deniers, but we need to convince the supporters to take action. 
 <br><br>


Just like the majority of Americans do not vote due to the belief that individual votes have no power, many of the people who are aware of whats happening to our planet are reluctant to take measurements that will drastically impact their lifestyle when they have no grantee that others will do the same and more importantly, know that it will be a bigger impact to them than it will for the planet. Rather than solely trying to convince the public of the existence of climate change, I believe that equal focus should be put into a motivational campaign to convince people to take action.

I have read the book Merchants of Doubt before and I remember while reading it, I was completely baffled. The ignorance and manipulation into diverting attention away from the truth of tobacco was amazing in the worst way possible. I think a lot of people also were able to be easily swayed since it is easier accepting a comforting lie that provides no reason to discourage tobacco. One of the things I remember reading was about The Nierenberg Acid Rain Peer Review Panel. The panel had made changes to the official report of acid rain in order to weaken the message that acid rain was a serious problem. This was just one way they "sowed the seeds of doubt" in regards to climate change and the effects of tobacco. It also did not help that there were feelings of skepticism from the Reagan White House, rather than emphasize on the settled knowledge, the uncertainties were emphasized which also spread doubt throughout people's minds. Another reason why it's so easy to sway people is because it's easier and comforting to ignore such a huge and terrifying problem, but it's getting harder and harder to hide from.  We see the effects of climate change happening all around us and I hope all the skeptics and deniers come to their senses and realize it's very real and change needs to happen soon.

I know understand why climate activists and environmentalists are frequently battling with mental illness and depression. Going back to English 22, where a we watched several documentaries that referred to mental health and practices like mediation, I was confused. We need to solve climate change, why are we worried about how we feel? This fight feels endless, against an opponent who is strong, more powerful, richer than us. But we can't stop.  The consequences are too dire if we lose. 
 <br><br>

It's frustrating fighting for such an important cause, the plant that houses us all, democrats, republicans, and even the geniuses behind the climate change denial. 
 <br><br>

The denialist's arguments, despite being extremely well thought. out, have no substance. There is little to no scientific evidence to support their argument. There isn't even one argument for these deniers. They just want to disagree with the activists. 
 <br><br>

Every denier has a terrible reason for denial: they are corrupt, they are afraid of Communism, or they are a blind sheep following whatever the leader of their party tells them too. It is incurably frustrating that such. small, insignificant group is creating this much stalling on this issue. Every second counts. We cannot allow them to stall any more. We need to take action immediately.

I found the documentary "A Climate of Doubt" to be a very interesting film because it showed the other side of the debate.The problem is that this is not a debate. This is real and it is happening infant of our eyes. After watching this documentary I am astonished that people can still be swayed to believe that there is no climate crisis and that the consequences we are facing are just "natural phenomena." I think it is important for more documentaries like this to be made to inform the public. In fact, I think that sources of information like this should be apart of required courses or readings etc. in school. Now, I'm not saying that forcing one side of climate change information down kids throats is what we should do, but rather kids be required to watch or read something that shows both sides of the argument and let the kids decide what they believe. This film was so eye opening and I cannot even imagine how someone could debate the facts after watching such a film. 
 <br><br>

I think what really frustrated me was the idea that people who have no clue what they are talking about are creating doubt in the eyes of the public and allowing more and more damage to be done to our planet. People like Christopher Monckton who have no scientific background    are the ones standing in the way of change. Rather than show any type of evidence against climate change these people use discussion about money, the economy and the American dream to put a stop to actions towards climate change. 
 <br><br>

The part I find the most amusing is that Fred singer doesn't even believe in the effects of second hand smoke.

In A Climate of Doubt, John Hockenberry raises a concern about how political views are intertwined with climate change issue by interviewing many politicians, scientists, and skeptics. For me, it is surprising to hear many of them think that climate change is not a big issue and is not human-made, and the fact of global warming is not based on science but is a political consensus. Professor Hiltner mentions that if something is agreed on by 97% of the professionals, it would be reckless and futile to tread the water in the opposite direction. It is hard for me to understand that people who own a great deal of knowledge and call themselves scientists failed to recognize the gravity of the environmental issue, especially it was the one that has been put on the table. What’s more, the momentum towards action on global warming is vanishing should be taken seriously since we cannot just take things (the earth provides us) for granted but need to think about our next generation and how could they live in a good life like we do now. As long as people are misled by the debate, research and solutions to the climate crisis will not be pushed forward and even solved. Luckily, nowadays most people have realized that global warming has become a serious problem, and with more education and information propagandized online, more and more people will be able to know the truth and take actions together to face the climate crisis.

I used to think climate change should be a political issue, because the government is the most powerful organization that can solve this problem. Giving this problem to government was the most effective and was the only way to solve this problem. I believed that they could immediately control this issue by setting laws to limit the negative effect that industries or humans had on earth.However, I never imagined that the action made by governments was totally different from my expectation. From this documentary, I knew that seven years ago,  the climate change topic first became a hot topic among the world, and every country were trying to find solutions to stop this tendency. However, a group of people intentionally advocated a false truth that made politicians into a dilemma. They advocated that the climate change was not proven by the science yet and it could not be proven that it was caused by human. So this idea almost made many influential politicians claiming that this climate change was not a truth so that they did not take action to control this problem, which almost brought destructive result to the earth. When I watch this film, I imagine that I would feel very disappointed and pessimistic about saving the earth from climate change if I was in 2012. But now I feel more optimistic since I know the government are taking action right now to control this issue and saving the earth. I would not recommend this film to my friends, since I think The government has changed, they are taking actions now. There is no need for my friends to have negative attitude to the government based on the things they have done long before.

“A Climate of Doubt” was a very thought-provoking film for me. I’m rarely ever exposed to climate skeptics and the other side of the argument, and it’s interesting seeing these people that believe so strongly in their “truth” that climate change is a hoax. Their motivations to provide scientific truth was especially curious to hear about.
 <br><br>
The people in this film seemed so fully convinced that their view on the climate was correct, it makes me wonder: Do these climate skeptics really believe so strongly in their truth, or are they aware of the real problem and just presenting an alternative “truth” to propagate their political agenda? Furthermore, if they’ve already seen the science and understand that at least 97% of scientists say climate change is real, what will it take to convince them otherwise? Can they be convinced or would that be a hopeless endeavor? In addition, it’s interesting seeing that people are more concerned about the loss of jobs when the alternative is an issue that’s far more catastrophic: the devastation of our entire planet. Our view is so shortsighted and so temporary; the problems won’t matter if everything is destroyed.
 <br><br>
It was interesting hearing the other side of the debate, especially having grown up in a liberal area where climate change skeptics were a tiny tiny percent of the population. This film opened my eyes to not only the alternative opinions, but it made me think about what the motivation behind those opinions are.

I believe that the majority of climate change deniers are motivated by an outside factor other than their beliefs. I think this is especially true for the individuals and organizations that are actively publishing their options, because they are most likely being sponsored or paid off by large corporations in the fossil fuel industry. There is no doubt that there are individuals who truly believe climate change is not happening, but I do not believe that is the case for groups such as the Heartland Institute. I would like to believe we can convince these groups of people to change their viewpoint, but the problem comes down to more than morals and opinions. As long as these individuals are making substantial profit from fossil fuel corporations, they are going to continue to push their viewpoint onto the public even if they are false. They are much more concerned in making money than doing what is morally correct. 
 <br><br>

I also thought it was very interesting that the idea of losing jobs was such a big concern. I do not think many people realize the large-scale effects that our planet is going to face if we do not begin to mitigate this problem. If our world continues to deteriorate as it is right now, we won't even have an adequate planet to have a society in general. We need to be proactive in fighting this problem. Alternatively, by making simple switches to more alternative sources of fuel, more jobs will open up. If more citizens begin to flood those markets, they will need to expand and therefore hire more workers. I don't believe the argument regarding a loss of jobs was very thought out.

NEWT GINGRICH: I— I believe we don't know.

When the most powerful political party in your country won't even recognize a scientific consensus you have a problem. When that same political party then chooses to villainize those who recognize the consensus and attempt to remedy the situation, you have a crisis. The amount of dirty money in our democracy has effects that reach far outside the climate crisis. We spend more than 700 billion dollars on our military every year, we can't regulate big banks, and the one that stings the most to me as a scientist is we can't even rely on basic scientific facts. The climate of doubt will only ensure that nothing gets done and by the time we realize how badly we as a species messed up all we can do is watch as the planet that gave us life turns on us and wipes the flame of humanity out forever.

The film  “A Climate of Doubt” made me realize how trueing ignorant our government is about climate change. They refuse to believe it is true because 97% of the scientists believe that climate change is caused by humans and they instead rather believe it is not caused by humans. When many of the conservatives were asked about climate change they would either walk aways and not answer or say that they were not going to answer the question if they think that climate change is cause by humans. In the film they stated how in certain states in the U.S they prohibited the use of climate change ti be talked about. Presidents are also quite about climate change and refuse to speak about it. It astonished me that fossil fuel businesses would spent as mush money as they could so they could make people doubt that there was a climate crisis.
 <br><br>
Many politicians have made it seem like climate change is just another one of many theories.Many of the politicians are now saying that the science to the climate change is not leading to a fire conclusion, that there is just not enough evidence to prove that it is c caused by humans. Once again this all has to do with money because fossil fuel are making many of the conservatives rich. Just like Ken said, they are not going to like if they put a limit to the amount fossil fuels they can use because they will lose a lot of money. Right now they believe that world revolves around money but this planet will no longer exist, so why do they want all that money for. Why do we let such ignorant group of individuals decide they laws for us, it is not only their fault but also ours for electing them.

I agree, it was really frustrating to see how people within our government are responding to climate change. I liked when they were interviewing it and posed not that 97% of scientists agree but that only 3% disagree. I also thought it was very childish that these very educated men directed around questions regarding anthropogenic climate change. It is very absurd that huge businesses care so much about creating doubt in the public eye. These huge companies are so interested in their money that they refuse to make changes even if it means hurting the future. 
 <br><br>

I thought it was crazy that politicians were denying that there was enough evidence that climate change is increasing the numbers of fires. When every resident across the world can notice the decrease in rainfall. Another issue along with limiting the number of fossil fuels is not only the money these companies will be losing, but also money that politicians will be losing. This is the biggest reason why we are not making any progress with new regulations. Many politicians are funded by these huge fossil fuel companies which influence their votes. The point you made is very strong that if we do not begin to change our lifestyle choices it will not matter how much money anyone makes. The worst part is the reason why we allow such an ignorant group of people to create our laws is because these huge companies are successful in creating doubt… How are we going to be able to transform our government is the step we need to take.

I find it very heartbreaking in the film A Climate of Doubt when Myron Ebell's response to "if climate skeptics were to be wrong" was just "I would be sorry." An empty sorry is definitely a heartless sorry. This apology will simply not make up for those who lost their homes, loved ones, and had to relocate. Throughout the film, I was extremely frustrated with the individuals who simply have more power than many of us do. With all the power they have, they do not do much to help our planet. How are we supposed to look up to politicians that claim to be fit for the country but cannot even take some action into helping the world? I believe that it is sad to say that everything seems to roll back to cruciality of voting; although, at this point, how are we supposed to know who will actually do the job and take action for the planet? Instead of screwing us over in the future, politicians are meant to protect the people with the policies and laws they pass. A simple apology is extremely useless to me if a change in their actions are not expressed. Many anti-climate change arguments seem to continue to be bias in the film as well as in general. How does one not believe in climate change when several natural disasters occur so often? How are individuals so ignorant with facts that occur right in front of them? These questions simply rolled around my mind while watching this film. It is simply devastating knowing the fact that those with power take such an important role, but do not use that power to simply help. Fossil fuels are going to continue to ruin our planet and once these ignorant individuals see that, it just may be too late.

Watching “A Climate of Doubt” was frustrating. I paused the film multiple times to ask myself, “Are they serious right now?” I was frustrated because I realized that these fossil fuel companies have such a big role in how the next decades will be for the world (if there are any). The part of the film that surprised me the most is when I learned that deniers purposely  used tobacco advertisement strategies for their climate denying commercials. Aside from this, it  has always confused me why climate change is seen as a political issue. But after watching “A Climate of Doubt,” it’s now clear as to how this happened. The climate crisis has been made into a political debate, when in fact there should be no debate about it. The climate crisis is real, it is happening, and the wealthiest companies have intentions to deny it as long as they are able to keep hold onto their capitalistic treasures.

The film “Climate of Doubt” gives the complex background to the climate crisis, emphasizing how climate deniers have built their arguments and persuaded thousands of people to believe climate change is a hoax. I found it interesting to learn the reasoning behind a climate change denier’s thinking, including, “It’ll [climate] change no matter what we do. It’ll get warmer and it’ll get colder” and “CO2 is a good thing. It’s plant food.” As frustrating as the ignorant comments made me, I found the most irritating part of the film to be about the Oregon Petition. Climate change deniers create authentic looking documents and reports to build “credibility” to falsified information creating a façade that there is scientific data proving that climate change is fake. It comes to my mind that these people will do anything to prove to others that they are not wrong, and instead of even considering the facts, deniers constantly swerve the other direction and take whatever necessary steps to protect their opinion. The other irritating part I found was about the climate graphs, how people can find cooling trends when picking a beginning and end point without looking overall at the data of global warming. It is crazy to think that people can get away with tempering data to gain a following.

The film “A Climate of Doubt” tells the frustrating tale of the lack of action in Washington on the issue of climate change. Climate change and its consequences used to be on the forefront of politics and was a key point of Obama’s election, however it soon took a back seat. This is not because of the lack of urgency, but because fossil fuel companies poured millions and millions of dollars into politician’s campaigns to make them downplay the issue. There was once even a commercial of Nancy Pelosi (D) and Newt Gingrich(R) both endorsing climate change legislation. These days are long gone as the issue has become very partisan due to the doubt cast upon the science by fossil fuel companies. The most frustrating part is that good, factual, science has been around for decades telling us this is happening, and yet all it takes is advertising and campaign funding to cloud the truth in the public’s eye.

<p>
In the film “A Climate of Doubt”, a debate between two groups is introduced, one claims that climate changing has negatively affected us, and the other, including supporters of fossil fuel companies, argues that global warming is just meaningless bravado. As those companies can benefit from denying climate crisis since it will allow them be able to continue exploring on fossil fuels, their supporters are not that reliable and credible.
 <br><br>
On the other side, I was so angry that these wealthiest fossil fuel companies made money by extracting fossil fuels that they control. In this way, they were pursuing their own interest while pushing people into the abyss. As worlds’ famous and wealthiest groups, they are fighting for their own benefits, instead of those of the planet and its life, including us, human beings. What’s serious, politicians even ignore the problem of climate crisis and questions for reliability of human activity imperiling the planet. I feel shame on those leading skeptics who spread their misinformation to people for lobbying money and political power.

It's sad that this whole issue has become so political. It shouldn't be, but because of people's obsession with how their money/power will be affected in the present, they deny thorough scientific study that points toward primarily human caused global warming. I just really don't like the thought of people blatantly disregarding credible data, and it's also irritating to see whole crowds of people getting together to scream about how climate change isn't real when they aren't actually informed about the subject. Those types of people seem only to care about their taxes going up. These politicians only seem to care about getting elected. The fossil fuel businesses seem only to care about raking in profits for as long as possible. Out of all these people, none of them seem to be thinking about the future. Everything that has made this issue a political one is selfishness.

A Climate of Doubt made me reflect on the climate crisis and how accurately it is portrayed. The ratio of skeptics is a mere 31,500 scientists versus the rest of the world. Despite this, skeptics are still managing to entice the public with their agenda. In addition to being broadcast on news channels that draw in millions of viewers, anti-climate change movements such as the “Cap and Trade” movement contribute to the growing doubt of climate change, making it difficult for the public to consider the truth: climate change is indeed real, and it is happening now.
 <br><br>


After watching the film, I realized that the climate crisis has become closely affiliated with politics. Climate change has been labeled as a “left-wing term,” and all politicians, regardless of belief, do not actively voice their beliefs on climate change for fear of losing votes. An example of this is Republican representative Bob Inglis at his last council meeting as a congressman. He stated, “Your child is sick. 98 doctors say, ‘treat him this way.’ two say, ‘No, this other is the way to go.’ “I’ll go with the two.” You’re taking a big risk for those kids.” After making this assertion, Inglis lost the majority of the Republican vote. It was brave of him to voice his opinion as a political figure, as his outreach to the general public was much more extensive than that of the average person’s. This quote really resonated with me because it was able to provide a new perspective on the climate crisis and the idiocy of its doubters.

We have a very long history of large companies profiting off of the suffering of people who have taken the bait that they were so temptingly fed. This devastating theme is seen with DDT, asbestos, tobacco, flame retardants, and even climate change. “Merchants of Doubt” is the first film I have seen that clearly lays out the methods of deception that corporations use to fool the public into a false sense of security. 

 <br><br>

It is so simple to think that if scientists publish facts that people will listen and changes will be made, but this simple and clearly logical concept is just a fantasy due to corporate greed. Just as quickly as scientists can publish their actually legitimate research, “think tanks” can “cherry pick” the data they want to use in a report that twists facts and supports the corporations that are causing problems. The Cato Institute even went a step further to make their report exactly mirror the layout of the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) report to make fooling people even easier. Most people, even politicians, would have trouble telling which report is factual because they put massive amounts of energy into making their “research” look official. All of these efforts are made to deceive people and ultimately to protect the wealthy corporations that they are secretly representing. 

 <br><br>

The part of the film I found particularly striking was when they discussed a study done that looked into scientific articles from 1992 to 2002 with the phrase “global climate change” to find how many agreed with anthropogenic climate change. All 928 articles were in agreement. There was not even one article that argued with the idea of anthropogenically caused climate change. The science behind climate change has never truly been the debate, the debate is truly political. People who want to profit off of harmful practices paint climate change as a debate by skewing things to make it seem as though there is not a consensus.

 <br><br>

Both “Merchants of Doubt” and “A Climate of Doubt” discussed Bob Inglis’ story and how despite being a conservative politician he looked at the facts and could not see how people could actually deny climate change. Inglis was obviously not reelected after he began sharing his newfound perspective on climate change and faced severe judgement, but this has not deterred him from trying to sway people to the side of science. Inglis is a rare example of a politician that was willing to stand with science and the well being of our planet even if it meant sacrificing his political power. This raises the question of if there are possibly any other conservatives that believe in climate change but do not take action to avoid personal consequence, placing their own careers over the fate of our planet. Both of these films discuss the deeply rooted corruption that is present in corporations and politics so this act of self preservation could be a real possibility.

This film was very eyeopening to me. For years I have wondered how climate change is even a debate when we have all of the facts and know that it is real. How then is it even a debate within politics? What can the skeptics even say against 97% of scientists. A Climate of Doubt answered this question. I see now how this group purposefully framed data and presented it to the public, along with the conspiracy theory of the far left propagating climate change for government funds, to make the public unsure what to believe. While I don't know how many people truly believe everything that these skeptics are saying, the pause to even consider their viewpoint takes away from the positivity of the issue and causes inaction so that these companies can further their interests. This is crazy! and awful! But what can I even do about it. I know that I believe scientists, but how can I make all of the Fox News viewers believe it too. Especially in the time where media outlets like Facebook are consciously allowing disinformation groups to spread this doubt online. It breaks my heart that this was once a bipartisan issue and has now been polarized. I cannot believe that the amount of americans that believed climate change was man made has dropped to HALF?? What! Heck no! I think the part of the film that really hit home for me was when the younger girl at the conference was talking about how much there is to learn from these "scientists" who are debunking climate change. I understand why the group is pushing their side of this issue, but the poor girl is really just convinced by what they are saying--she has no mal intent. SAD.

The film" A Climate of Doubt"  shows us the real problem behind the politics of climate changes. So, why don't governors or people deal with this problem? Is it really because they believe it is true that the climate change will not influence the humanity or it is because it cut off some rich people's way of income? I really want to ignore this problem since we can not be accessible to it and we can actually do nothing about it. But I mean the problem is there. Even if 97%of scientist believe that climate change is bad and existent, even if public learn about it, it will not be addressed effectively if the elites want to care less about it. I can say nothing more than I wish public, or those empowered people could all do something to solve this problem for good.

This week’s film “A climate of doubt” also talks about climate crisis being a political issue. It appears that once the heat of debate over whether climate change is a problem gets down, politicians starts to deny the significance of it. The veteran scientist Fred Singer, who used to be responsible for the climate satellites says that people have no effect over the change in climate - no matter what we do, it just change on its own- so there is nothing we can, or should do. I personally find this statement really unrealizable and irresponsible. Moreover, he claims that scientists is hyped on global warming. These so called “justifications for science” has caused the population who believed in human-caused climate crisis to decline dramatically. 
 <br><br>

The film also explains how people can create data which proves no climate increase in a certain time period. They often pick a decade within which the climate shows no overall increase, but actually if they look on a larger scale, the temperature overall increases obviously. It is frustrating to know that millions of people would be forced to move due to climate changes while some are still twisting the truth for political benefits. I was confused by the incentives of Fred Singer when he confidentially denies the human contribution to climate change.

<p>
From the title of the movie “A Climate of Doubt”, it is obviously to see that whether climate changing will impose heavy effects on the earth is still in debate; or at least to say, some of us are still unwilling to accept the theory even though most authoritative climate scientists claimed that the global warming is a big issue for us. Like the analogy made by Bob Inglis, a predominantly conservative politician, on the consensus the catastrophic results human-caused climate change will eventually brought with a sick child. “Your child is sick. 98 doctors say “Treat him this way.” Two say “No, this other is the way to go.” “I’ll go with the two.”” It is a vivid analogy depicted the situation now we are confronted: 98% of scientists have already reached the consensus that the climate change is real and is man-caused result. But most of us still choose to believe the rest of 2% who claimed that the climate change is a natural process which will not put serious effects in our daily life.
 <br><br>

Why do so many people prefer to remain in ostrich mode? The movie gives us answer: greed and egoism. The major opposition protests on the bill of carbon tax is a good evidence to prove the quality of ingrained greed and egoism one has possessed. For big companies, especially for oil companies, who will emit a large amount of carbon dioxide during the productive process, of course they are unwilling to pay for the carbon tax, which will greatly cut down their revenue. As for the ordinary, carbon tax means the reduction of employment opportunities in that most companies will choose to scale down operations in exchange for paying the tax.  Therefore, once the opposite statements or the doubts, which are devoted in retorting the actual facts, are put forth by others, they are embraced on a massive scale as they are matching the interests of the majority. Several sentences said by scientists in documentary could prove the claim above:
 <br><br>
“A lot of these groups were run by economists, litigators, lawyers and public policy specialists, people who specialize in getting a message out. This group may not have been scientists, but they were really good at this sort of thing. The explicit goal that was written down as part of this campaign was let’s create doubt, create a sense of balanced debate and make sure that these lines of skepticism and dissent become routinely a part of public discussion about climate science.” Because of greed and egoism, people do not care about the authority of the statements; they only care about whether those statements satisfy their own interests. But the truth is the climate change is an urgent issue now. Only if we take some actions immediately to reduce the reduction of carbon dioxide, our next generation may face  a destructive consequence as a result of global warming.

<p>
I found the film, “A Climate of Doubt” very interesting and honestly necessary because it provides both sides of the climate debate. While interesting, it was most definitely frustrating for anyone who agrees that climate change is an issue to watch. We see it constantly; politicians are faced with evidence yet they deny the evidence to the best of their ability. Actually, to say they do it to the best of their ability is a bit of a stretch because many of the opposing side often refuse to answer important questions regarding climate change. 
 <br><br>

Carol Davenport couldn’t even get an answer to her very straightforward questions. It’s because they don’t have genuine answers. All of their answers are filled with confirmation bias. They say things like, “But we need CO2!” or “The Earth has been warming and cooling since day one” and it’s like... how dense can you be? Even if you ignore the data, the effects of climate change are extremely evident. The deniers’ rhetoric is ultimately taking what is true about our environment (because, obviously we do need CO2 and yes the Earth has faced changes before) and exaggerating it enough to make people feel as if what we are currently dealing with is completely normal.
 <br><br>

I think what annoys me the most is the fact that these people can sit here and say (with their whole chest) that scientists don’t know what they’re talking about. One of the guys said that the scientists who agree that climate change is an issue are “entitled to their opinion” and I lost brain cells immediately. The people denying it aren’t even climate change scientists so, quite frankly, I don’t even want to hear their arguments because they never have solid evidence anyways. I still listen though, because I find it interesting that people can still be so skeptical when the evidence is right in their faces.

I agree with you on how the film was extremely frustration and hard to watch for the majority of us who believe in climate change. These politicians are and organizations, despite being loud about protecting freedom and the American way of life, are silent when it comes to very simply, scientific questions asked by the reporter. They are avoidant, and they are silent, because they are afraid; they're afraid that if they speak about climate change as a science it will be revealed that they know nothing, and it will be revealed that they are protecting their own monetary interests at the cost of our planet.
 <br><br>

I also find it intriguing that most of the funding for America for Prosperity comes from an organization called Donor's Trust and that it is not clear exactly how much money is coming from whom. I think in the same way that people are more inclined to verbally attacking others online, in this case, anonymity is so dangerous because it allows individuals to do whatever they want without any consequences, without "political fallout", as the video stated. To me, this is a group of very few people who are literally funding terrorism on our planet, and we can't fight back if we don't know who they are. And not until we find a way to publish their names, so that their character and credibility can be called into question, will we be able to gain equal footing on this battlefield.

In the movie Merchants of Doubt, capitalist greed and scientific data clash, casting doubt on anthropogenic climate change and the dire effects of fossil fuels. Through the use of hired spokespeople to cast doubt on scientific fact, the fossil fuel industry creates the perception of the environmentalist movement needing “more time” to do research while they continue to rake in profits in the billions. In reality, 99% of climate scientists agree on the conclusion that climate change is serious, increasing, and caused by human impact, specifically the mass production of fossil fuels. The playbook these corporations use to dismantle the idea of scientific consensus is casting doubt on climate change through the use of sharp tongued spokespeople making empirically ungrounded claims on national television. By convincing the public that there is still debate on the issue, they see no immediate reason to switch to cleaner energy sources, just as the tobacco industry reassured the public that cigarettes were not harmful to their health.

The Frontline documentary, “A Climate of Doubt” immediately garners audience attention by presenting the words “climate” and “doubt” in the same sentence. At first it made me think, “Doubt? What doubt? The climate crisis is real”, but it wasn’t until I started watching the film where I began to understand why it was titled such.
 <br><br>

A Climate of Doubt investigates a far more controversial side to the climate crisis than the other films we have watched for Eng 23—it delves into the world of politics and the role that climate change plays. 
 <br><br>

As Ken mentioned, 97% of climate scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change—however there are still groups and organizations that shame such scientists and politicians who believe in climate change by typically labelling them as “alarmists”. In addition, there are still people who believe that scientists are being paid to alter data in order to incite fear and realization in the general public. My take on it is, if 97% of scientists believe in the climate crisis, am I to believe they are all alarmists who tweak sensitive information vital to the future of our planet? No! The climate crisis is real, what more do deniers need in order to understand? 
 <br><br>

America is a progressive, fast paced, busy society. So I understand why so many Americans were upset over Obama’s cap and trade bill. However, I see it as an issue between the short run and long run. In the short run sure, cap and trade does diminish jobs, but in the long run, if we don’t implement bills like cap and trade, will there be a healthy planet for these jobs to even exist? In the long run, cap and trade was a step towards protecting the future of not only our planet, but everything inhabiting it.

One of the girls who was interviewed at the International Conference on Climate Change called climate change a fallacy. That brought to my mind other kinds of fallacies. The bandwagon logical fallacy (argumentum ad populum) suggests that a statement or idea should be believed because most people believe it. When you consider this in relation to the fact that 97% of scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change, I can partially understand deniers’ perspectives if you look at that statement at face value. However, this is not a bandwagon fallacy. The individuals who are defending this information aren’t just “people”–they’re experts in their field. They have experiments and data to back their beliefs. Climate change is only a conspiracy if you refuse to look at any of the facts that are readily available.

 <br><br>

I agree with you, this film was interesting since it was a different take on climate change. The other films we’ve watched focus on the broad range of effects of climate change or the impact that climate change has had on humans in our very own state of California. However, when politics are considered, climate change has even greater implications for our society and future.
 <br><br>


As you mentioned, American culture is a large factor in climate change denial. The idea of the self-made man or the American dream both have direct connections to the availability of jobs. You make a good point. Cap and trade bills will decrease the number of jobs in the market, but that cost is minor in comparison to the result of a better world for ourselves and our descendants. It’s frustrating and even sad to realize that some people only care about their own success and refuse to prioritize the livelihood of the earth and others.

It is common for us to know that climate change in the world right now has already make negative influence on our lives. Also, we know climate change is always a public topic that has been discussed over and over again. However, in this movie, it shows that a group of people thinking climate change is hoax. From their view, the hoax of climate change will limit people’s freedom to do hat ever they want and form a limited government. From my perspective, I think it is really ridiculous to know these because as we all know climate change is a serious problem that need to be fixed and improved as soon as we can. Thus, it is not fair for us to ignore climate change and “develop” our society without any worried. In this way, I think climate change is still an inevitable problem that need to be solved.

The film Climate of Doubt was extremely interesting to me because it addressed the side of climate change which I find to be of the greatest importance at this time in history. The political debate surrounding climate change is reminiscent to other major political debates of this nations history. The most notable parallel to me is the national debate surrounding slavery. The similarities are many, the political polarization, the drastic economic aspect, and the benefit of one group of individuals at dramatic cost to others. Much like the debate over slavery, both Ken and the documentary mention that those which benefit from CO2 emissions have already seen defeat in their future. The goal of this group of individuals has shifted to maximize profit before the legislation catches up with their actions. Essentially, they are attempting to out run the problem. I think this is interesting because it is not at all unexpected, in fact, it is exactly what human nature would predict. This correlation is interesting to me because human beings are incredibly susceptible to repeat history, thus, I would be very unsuprised if the issue of the climate crisis played out similar to the issue of slavery.

Learning from our history we can expect, in the best case, a drastic political change and a restructuring of our socioeconomic system. Similarly, in a historical lens, we can already see the fear of change and rise of tensions that this country endured in the 19th century. Besides the pure wonder of human nature this parallel raises a few interesting ideas. We can learn from the fear and mistakes of our past. Perhaps we can minimize the effects of this monumental issue by recognizing the mistakes made in the past. For instance, while certain events are destined to repeat themselves, the prospect of a civil war could still be avoided. If we fail to look at our past, however, the climate crisis could continue to worsen the political divide before we can improve.

"A Climate of Doubt" showed that the climate change deniers are set on viewing the topic of climate change as purely political. A lot of them do not have any scientific qualifications and use slanderous tactics to try and discredit the scientists. They also don't seem interested in actually learning about the science of climate change until the effects are actually here. They don't care that the implications are real and choose to ignore what will happen. I find it shocking that they don't even think "what if" and try to make the world prepared for such an event but they just keep denying it and causing more people to become misinformed. It's frustrating that with all the information and research out there, people can just outright choose to ignore it and cherry pick things that go with their ideals. The climate change deniers don't seem to want what's good for humanity but rather choose to make it a polarizing topic to divide the world's attention for their own personal gain. I think they don't want to tell us how much they're getting "sponsored" because that amount of money is obscene and they don't want people to know that they are getting paid to keep doing what they are doing. They view themselves on the side of freedom but they are just taking advantage of people who don't know any better. It's sickening the amount of resources they spend for non change for their own personal gain.

In the film, Merchants of Doubt, we are told the Tobacco Industry had kept its health risks hidden from the public and used what is known as a ‘playbook’ to go against scientific claims. A ‘playbook’ was designed to deny scientific evidence and present counterclaims in order to cast doubt among the public to continue to generate profit from the use of their products. In similar ways, people have been doing the same to go against climate change and other issues. People are providing the public with misinformation in order to gain them to view the climate crisis as misleading and false. Many people have sadly given into this playbook and see climate change as a hoax or not a result of human activities.
 <br><br>

Big corporations fail to display how much damage they are contributing to the environment. People also don’t realize by purchasing these products they are fueling the continuation of this production and contributing to climate change. Industries in addition to causing climate change, continue to have a number of effects on our environment including pollution to our air, water, and soil all of which causes serious health effects. They care more about wealth than human lives. 
 <br><br>

It was incredibly upsetting to see how long it took for people to realize the harmful effects smoking has as someone. What is even more upsetting is thinking about how long it will take for people to realize what effects climate change has on our environment. People need to see that climate change is happening now and the effects are severe. They need to come to the realization sooner and prevent what is expected to happen in the future.

After watching A Climate of Doubt, I'm in shock as to how little these people care about not only the planet but every living thing on it. During this film I just found myself getting more angry and frustrated as it went on. How could people with such a large impact be so inconsiderate about the information they spread???? Instead of using their influence to change the unsustainable way we do things, they use it to cater to their selfish, money-grabbing desires. Coming from a horribly conservative family, I have gotten the whole spiel from my mom about why climate change is fake and how I'm naive for believing in it. We, of course, got in heated fights over the subject, but after seeing this film, how could I blame her for believing the things the fossil fuel industries are shoving in her face? Hopefully, after sending this documentary to her, her perspective will change (i doubt it though).
 <br><br>
Corruption in our government is something we Americans know too well, but I think it goes much too far when it's not just the Americans being affected, but the whole world.  We are the culprits in a horrible crime against the Earth, and hopefully, the masses snap out of it before it's too late.

In this film, the director interviews scientists, reporters, and other people and let them speak out their opinion about Global Warming. Some people believe that Global Warming does not exist, all of the problems people are concern is just a hoax. It is interesting to hear what skeptics think because almost everyone knows or support that Global Warming is caused by human and they try to solve this problem. Even though 97% of scientists versus the small number of skeptics, they still believe their ideology and find evidence to rebuttal the scientists’ theory. I feel concern when I hearing that people think climate change was hyped by scientists and government. In 2007, there is a lot of topics about climate change, and people do take action. However, after a few years, people gradually not willing to believe climate change is man-made. They are unwilling to solve this problem.
 <br><br>
I think what we should focus on is the long-term problem. We should not only consider the money, the job, but our future, our descendant. I think Global Warming is real and it will become worse than before. People will regret in the future if they did not take action now.

After watching “Climate of Doubt”, I felt more enlightened about the politics of climate change. I knew there were skeptics, but it was surprising to see that the root of the denier’s argument is money and politics. So much of their argument can be tied back to the profits of fossil fuel industries and conservative profit in general. Their goal is to confuse the public and blind them to the truth and severity of the climate issue, which in reality is only exacerbating the issue. 
 <br><br>

As said by the representative of Wisconsin, James Sensenbrenner, “the people of this country were really not concerned one way or the other on [climate change] until the economy started going down in 2008.” This enhances the fact that the climate crisis and where people stand on this issue is much more political and money-driven for the conservative argument, rather than an issue of beliefs on science. Our country as a whole has become an individualist, consumer, capitalist country. These ideologies encourage us to focus on ourselves and improving our lives no matter the consequences. This fast-paced mindset strengthens the skeptic view of climate change in terms of policies as well. Skeptics wouldn’t want a carbon tax or “cap and trade” to help save the future generations. Since there is no harm seen or felt from climate change in the present moment, there is a lack of support for laws and regulations that would help prevent and mitigate the climate crisis issue.

While watching the episode I felt similar feelings. We know that at the root of most climate denial research is an agenda being pushed by Big Oil and routinely accepted by their constituents. It's hard to invoke any change because people live sedentary lifestyles, and a lot of people benefit from burning fossil fuels; a lot of us drive cars, support an over-polluting beef market and partake in a fast culture that produces a lot of clothing waste.  When a large proportion of our policy is heavily backed and supported by Big Oil how can we expect them to push for policies that will ultimately force their contributors to change their ways? As a money-driven economy, profits are still within fossil fuels and a shift to renewable sources would have to come from government-sanctioned regulations. We're still a long way from solving the climate issue and getting support from our policymakers is an important first step.

This week’s film, Climate of Doubt, left me with more questions on the climate crisis than ever before. How could a single politician have enough power to sway such a large percentage of our nation against climate change? How could members of my generation and the politicians leading us not see the danger in our futures? Why is it so difficult for someone to accept scientific fact? The way in which this film jumped back and forth between ideas and arguments made me struggle to understand the bigger picture or its plot, but it did open my eyes to the bigger picture of the climate crisis itself. It seems as though over the course of the class I have already learned so much about this issue. Although, this week’s film gave me a look into the inner workings of the opposing side and what I saw was less impactful than expected. 
 <br><br>

The most intriguing part of Climate of Doubt to me, was when the female reporter spoke of her idea to ask every Republican member of Congress three simple questions about climate change. The first was, “Do you think climate change is causing the Earth to become warmer?” The second was, “How much if any of that is attributable to human activity?” and lastly, “What’s the appropriate government response?” While watching this part of the film, I thought of how simple these questions should be to answer and how important their responses really are. The average American citizen depends on our Congressman to make decisions that will benefit all and when she continued in explaining how these people actually responded, I was amazed. She said that the Congressman didn’t even want to reply and they, in some cases, said they were not even going to answer. What was even more shocking was that some of them even ran into an elevator just to avoid giving a response. I continued to learn, that with their majority in the House, GOP lawmakers took steps to keep climate change from coming up at all my. They even furthered their effort of silencing the issue by dissolving the official House committee on global warming. This to me was brand new information. How do they expect this issue to be solved if they won’t even let people hear about it? The saddest part is, that based off of their actions, it seems as if they don’t want this issue to be solved. They see our nation is divided over the climate crisis and instead of fighting for a better future for their country, they are worsening the divide and taking away our chance to better the situation.

After watching the film, A Climate of Doubt, I was most interested to learn about the political action the climate crisis was causing in the years around 2008. I was only around 7 years old at the time the American public, and government, decided that the issue of "global warming" deserved a front seat in the policy making agenda, so of course I do not vividly remember the way society was reacting to this new environmental awakening. Instead, I only remember the times of climate change being an issue that divides people based primarily on political party affiliation, which I think is such a shame. There was a clip in the video from 2008 that depicted speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, alongside Newt Gingrich a republican, where they were both endorsing political action to address the climate issue. A few years later, in 2011, Gingrich came out to say that he regretted making the same exact advertisement. I just don't understand how so many people went from being worried and eager to act upon a more sustainable lifestyle to outright denying or belittling its existence in the matter of a few years. It's scary to me how powerful and successful the big oil companies like Exxon were at manipulating the narrative regarding climate action to equate to things such as economic recession. I feel like America was truly ready to act for change after events such as Al Gore's films, and then a few large companies who would not benefit economically were able to successfully create enough doubt and skepticism regarding the climate change phenomenon that ultimately deemed it a "controversial" issue... when in fact it's just our earth's reality. Although the consequences of climate change were not felt nearly as heavily back in 2012, there is no denying that the evidence is becoming more and more undeniable. Unfortunately, I believe that it is not until a multitude of truly devastating climate related incidents occur directly to the American people that the government and its constituents will genuinely work to legislate for change. Finally, it's truly frustrating to see people argue with the statistic that 97% of climate scientists agree that climate warming is linked to human related activities.

A Climate of Doubt highlights the motives and actions of people countering and opposing the scientific consensus that is climate change. The most shocking element to me was the fact that the climate change deniers didn’t truly care about the science or the planet. Their efforts to oppose climate change obviously contain greedy ulterior motives. Seeing how little they cared about the fact that they’re opposing the overwhelming scientific consensus, I realized that climate change deniers are opposing the science with anything but science. With the use of stinging political ads and rhetoric, climate change deniers are faking their way to legitimacy.
 <br><br>
Additionally, it’s incredibly concerning to see how much climate change has become tangled in politics. What should be a global problem than transcends party lines, climate change has been turned into a divisive to avoid. It’s a bit spineless how the politicians weakened their stance on climate change. But a part of that is understandable seeing how Ingils was condemned for being republican and believes in climate change. However, at the end of the day, their change in stance only reflects the growing doubt that beginning to plague the American public.

As mentioned by the professor, our generation also has many remedial measures, and many behaviors can improve the current climate change situation, such as driving less and riding more bicycles to reduce carbon emissions, replacing large houses with small apartments, or moving directly to cities, which can effectively reduce the use rate of cars. People living in cities rarely use cars to work Because home and company are never too far away. It should be that we should reduce the waste of food. Every extra share of meat produced will produce carbon emissions that cannot be ignored. Nowadays, food waste is emerging in an endless stream. We should take more actions to reduce waste. The fourth is to reduce the number of children. No couple can raise no more than one child in the end. Because the earth can't bear more people, we must take measures to reduce the number. Finally, we need to buy less things, such as clothes. Every time we buy more goods, we will increase the carbon emission, so we should buy less and maintain more existing products. There are things we can do with our generation s to improve the global warming and climate change as carbon production is keep rising nowadays while most people still refuse to accept and take part in to improve the situation.

The documentary “ A Climate of Doubt” describes the hot topics of climate change in American politics. It efficiently displays different ideas and aspects from a verity of politicians and authoritative organizations. Most of the comments and opinions are negative towards the scientific explanations of climate change. These authoritative speakers still wonder if climate change is due to human activities or they just a periodic change of nature. However, In my view after watching the documentary, it is astonishing that some politicians deliberately misinterpret the scientific data on climate change and refuse to face reality. Besides, some of them even published books, articles, and papers to deceive themselves as well as the crowds. They just focus on the present benefits they earned through destructing and exhausting natural resources instead of thinking about the detrimental consequences in the future. After watching the documentary, I felt pessimistic about the situation since people are too cowardly to face their mistakes and it is hard for them to protect nature by depriving their advantages.

I like to believe that I am a person who wants to know every angle and piece of information I can about topics I am not informed about before projecting my own opinions and thoughts. Before watching the documentary “Climate of Doubt,” I was very curious to finally understand the motives and argument that deniers and skeptics have against the climate crisis. Frankly, I am not impressed. If anything, I am disappointed. I feel like the deniers and skeptics in the film provided no real evidence of why deniers do not believe in the fast approaching consequences the climate crisis will have on all life on this planet. I find it amazing the lengths that the fossil fuel industry and other big companies that benefit from these detrimental practices will go to, just to keep the flow of money into their pockets. It is kind of terrifying to believe that one side of this argument had the power and funds to completely shift the views of a vast majority of the American public. To shift their views away from science for the sake of profit. I get that they will most likely die before they feel any real consequences of climate change, but do they not have younger generations of family or friends to think about? These consequences will be dumped on them, and on all life on this planet.

What really ticked me off is when one presenter at one of their little anti climate change conventions presented a graph of the global temperature trends and essentially said, see the Earth is actually cooling! What he failed to mention, and what I believe a climate scientist made clear, is that you can see periodic trends of cooling of the Earth’s global temperature if you scale the graph differently. If you bring that same graph to a larger scale, even with those periodic trends of cooling, the Earth is still warming at a constant rate. I thought that was extremely negligent and manipulative. That audience fully believed it, and had no doubt in their minds that what he was saying was skewed to fit what they believe. When watching that scene I was grateful for the education and curriculum I have received because one of the best things I have learned from all of these years of school is to always question what you see and hear. Never read one article or website and take it in its entirety. I like to believe that I have created a habit of always doing my own research on topics whenever something is new to me. Regardless, I was honestly shocked and saddened by the extreme efforts the other side goes through just for money. As if they do not have enough already.

As mentioned in the previous article,”the doubt of the climate”, serious problems are reflected. People, oil tycoons always try to spend money to hide the truth about the serious consequences of climate change. Rich and powerful oil bosses and companies deny the problems caused by climate change because they care about the underground natural gas and oil resources they can exploit, so they will try their best to distort the reality, make as much use of the underground natural resources as possible, and make money when the situation becomes worse. Before they are ordered to stop, they will do so, constantly confusing the public and thus confusing the public To make money.
 <br><br>
The battle between oil and gas bosses and climate scientists will continue until the worst results are brought about by climate change, but by that time it will be too late, so I hope that scientists and climate scientists can get more support. Winning in the battle of theory is really a crucial step to fight against climate change, because that's the way Can make you believe and take action to stop climate change.

The film “Merchants of Doubt '' made very clear is just how easy the vast American public can be deceived. All that climate change skeptics have to do is plant the seed of doubt in the minds of the American public, while climate change activists face the enormous burden of proving that anthropogenic climate change is very real and the ramifications are being seen all over the world right now. On top of that, climate change activists often grassroots going up against some of the most powerful and wealthy men and women in the world. It makes me sick seeing people so adamantly denying the validity of the climate crisis for their own personal gain while innocent people are dying all over the world so that tycoons can add yet another million to their personal fortune. But what I don't understand is how they can think so short-term. Sure, the fossil fuel industry is making you millions right now. Great. But even if you don't care about the millions of lives that will be changed or lost by the effects of the climate crisis, think of yourself. The amount of money that will be lost having to clean up and handle natural disasters will be a fortune. And that is for just as long as there is an earth that we can destroy. Who cares if you're rich if our earth will be uninhabitable in the near future? The deception taking place by the people that Americans put their trust in to make good decisions for the well being of our country- our politicians- are grossly irresponsible, short-sided, and selfish. Watching politicians act, specifically knowing that no one wants to leave the comfort of their established lifestyle if there really isn't much to worry about, is very frustrating. Much like all films and readings we have done, this film left me frustrated and a little hopeless. But, this film really showed that climate skeptics rely on is that people will not educate themselves. Information is the enemy of the climate skeptics and all we can do is educate ourselves and the people around us to work against the seed of doubt that is being planted in the minds of the American public.

The film Climate of Doubt provides me different perspectives on the issue of climate change and also reveals the motivations behind those different views, allowing me to more thoroughly understand the background of the debate on anthropogenic climate change. Before watching the film, I have not associated climate change with politics and profits a lot, but this film allows me to consider the issue within a more realistic and practical context, especially that of the US. This film, as Ken clarifies in the lecture video, also vividly reflects the battle between two groups: the fossil fuel industry and a range of individuals who are urgent to keep the Earth welcoming. 
  <br><br>

Although I can feel the value of the film and its aim to reveal the political and commercial aspects of the debate around anthropogenic climate change, I should admit that I felt rather hard to understand the content of this film, at least when compared to the previous films we watched (i.e. Leonardo’s Before the Flood and Frontline’s Fire in Paradise). I am an international student growing up in Beijing and am not familiar with the political background of the US, so sometimes I don’t really understand the exact thing people in the film have conflict about. What I felt include the complex political disputes and individual interests involved in the topic of human-caused climate change. After watching the film, my view on climate change broadened as I understand it is not only an issue about environmental sciences but also politics, society, and money. The revelation provided by the film allows me to consider the issue in a more well-rounded and realistic way. 
  <br><br>

After watching the film, I also reflected on the extent of authenticity of anthropogenic climate change. I believe there are surely certain aspects of climate change that are mainly driven by human activities, but I also think natural cycle or variations might play a role in the long term. After watching the film, I felt a bit more perplexed as I saw more different opinions and factors associated with climate change and our responsibility in it, but I also think this is a crucial process towards my clearer understanding of the issue and firmer actions toward it.

The first thing I noticed when starting the documentary was the fact that 95% of people at this convention are easily over the age of 65. I think my favorite quote actually from the movie was that CO2 was good for the environment because it is “plant food.” I guess what really confuses me regarding the climate crisis deniers is what motivates you. The things we practice too better the environment are all positive anyway. Recycling, walking instead of driving, moving towards releasing less carbon emissions. None of these aspects are harming anyone or anything so why be so against it. After watching more of the video I realized that people believed that the tax was leading to unemployment but would you rather be unemployed or dead. The economy crashing was definitely not helpful to get people on board about the climate problem. Everyone was worried about money and having a tax on something that they weren’t quite sure was even true, really only helped the skeptics. A really interesting part was when they showed that you can pick any time period of 10 years and show a decease in temperature; but when you zoom out and look at it from a larger stand point of say 100 years, it is significantly increasing. 97-98% of climate scientists say that climate change is man made. I don’t consider myself republican or democrat, but it seems to me that republicans always side with the way that gets them more tax money back. Our earth is literally dying and they still only care about how much money the government needs from us to try and make a difference.

The nature of the climate crisis existence should not be politically debated. There was a point in history, where Democrats and Republicans both agreed on the dangers of global warming. This is shown through the advertisement with Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingirch, both on very different ends of the political spectrum. Climate change turned into a political debate, when it should not have. The future of the only planet we have should not be a debate. 
  <br><br>

This debate is being fueled by giant oil corporations who profit off of the political gridlock. It’s incredibly frustrating to see several Americans supporting a cause that is not in their best interest. 
  <br><br>

Despite it being the shortest film we’ve assigned, it was the most difficult to watch. Repeatedly, I’ve had to pause the film and give myself a break from the stupidity that was illuminated on my screen. Never has a film frustrated me to this extent. It’s difficult to watch people deny the truth and spread these lies across the world. 
  <br><br>

It scares me that the future of our world is in the hands of corrupt, old, white men who know they will leave the world soon. 
  <br><br>

However, this film successfully communicates its message; it scared and frustrated me, the viewer. This film is intended for people who are interested in the politics of climate change, but want to learn more about it.

After watching this week’s film, “A Climate of Doubt”, I believe it is now safe for me to say that this debate on climate crisis is no longer a scientific debate, but a scientific and political one. To be more exact it is a debate between those who care about the well being of the planet against those who are fighting back for their own advantages in the political spectrum. Much like the reading, this film was rather disappointing to watch through as you can see through my initial claim why. One of the things that I found unfortunate while watching the film was how they explained that many people were on board with climate change and that it was through mankind’s CO2 emissions that the temperature changes were occuring. All it took was to take a step backward in the fight against climate crisis was the Great Recession in 2008 which led to many deniers being born that were once on the opposite side. Although the film did not cover it too much I found it surprising because I did not know that before. For me the most frustrating part of the film was listening to the retired Physicist Fred Singer talk. It was frustrating because of how he will deny facts of temperature rising, saying that it happens all the time and then drops again, but will accept the Oregon Petition of deniers because of the large number of over 31,000 signers. Singer truly believes that everyone on that list are qualified and that is why he takes it to be true. The reality is that only ⅓ of those signers have a Ph.D. while the rest consist of friends and celebrities with the minimum requirement of signing is by just having a Bachelor of Science. Then proceeds to deny a list that shows 97% of the climate scientists that say climate change is a man made issue. This reasoning is flawed in many ways and makes me aggravated because a man using this logic along with the Heartland Institute are beginning to convince more people to become deniers that do not get to truly look at the bigger picture. 

  <br><br>

In all honesty this film was really hard to watch, not because it was sad but because of how these deniers continue to spread false information to those that need to be guided to making their own decision most. It is easy to make any argument sound right when it is strongly biased in its approach. This film was not poorly done by any means as it accurately depicts the debate of climate change which is the political vs. the scientist. The film even talked about how some of these big name deniers receive up to 40% of their funding from oil companies. This alone should be a clear indicator that this debate is extremely political and does not focus on the real issue of a planet in critical condition.

"A Climate of Doubt", shows the ugly truth : the climate crisis is a solvable problem. It is not a problem that requires scientific resources, but rather the shift in political views for those that are calling the shots. This is prominent as clear evidence is denied over and over; rising ocean levels, and CO2 emission reports are ignored by those who do not believe in climate change. It soon becomes apparent that it is not pure ignorance that pushes the anti-climate view, but rather the stance they take stems from their money. Those who deny climate change are most often those who will be negatively affected by stricter laws regarding the subject. A big example of this would be fossil fuel companies; of course they will try everything in their power to look for evidence that proves that climate change is a hoax. The problem is that the delusion of climate change denial is not entirely conscious, but rather oftentimes a subconscious effort from those in power to stay in power and remain wealthy.
  <br><br>

I agree with you how disappointing it was to watch all the active misinformation that is being spread by these climate change deniers. The actions of oil companies now parallel the cigarette companies in the past. They constantly deny the harm caused by their products, and instead turn peoples attention to meticulously crafted data that supports their own narrative.

<p>
To be honest, I am deeply believed in climate change was caused by humans. So when I watching the film "A Climate of Doubt", for me, it is not that interesting as the previous two films. But I do have something I want to say.
   <br><br>


Firstly, the scientists in the film said other scientists who supported the anthropogenic climate crisis were controlled by politics. However, how can they verify that they, who thought climate change is a natural trend, were not affected by the political viewpoint? A common sense that the Democrats are supporting the anthropogenic theory, while the Republics believe the other way. "if you pay scientists enough money, they’ll find what you want them to find". This is said in the film, and it works for both Democrats and Republics. Take the example in the film: the cap-and-trade, which announced by Obama. From the film, we knew that Democrats were supporting this action, while most Republics voted nay. As the scientists in the film said they were successful in telling people climate change is not a problem, can I also say it is the achievement that Republics opposed Democrats' action. Meanwhile, this cap-and-trade is denying by so many American citizens is because it made the tax expensive which "threaten" their life.

Secondly, most of the evidence those scientists gave to audiences in the film was based on temperature which didn't explain the other sides of climate change. Yes, the temperature trend might due to earth itself, but how do you explain the deadly weather? Climate change is not only about global warming, but also extreme weather, unusual weather.

The documentary "merchants of doubts" is very similar with the book but it has more details. It uses people from the industry to show how public relation works in this kinds of problems. After I watch this film, I find it very ironic. Today's situation is no longer find out the truth or debates among scientist to find out what is happening. Instead it is the real scientist vs fake scientist. Although we know debates and questions are important, but this debate is non-fair at all. Scientists are focus on study whereas these fake scientist are good at speaking. When you put these two groups together, it is easier for fake scientists to win. Also, the gas industry create a lot of organizations with big title and write reports by a group of scientist which were not real scientists. They uses these reports to persuasive citizens to prove there is no global warming. Additionally, when they realize they can not keep saying there is no global warming, they change it to the new topic that there is global warming but not caused by human etc. These PR has a system method to brainwash people, just like people from the smoking industry and they might even be the same group of people. It is sad that we are not fighting against science, we are fighting against politics. We know the facts, we just can not do anything due to these big companies or politics. What a sad truth.

It is unfortunate that we have shifted the focus from taking action against climate change to convincing people that climate change is real.  It is especially concerning that the science behind climate change is no longer the thing that is preventing us from taking action, since 97% of scientists have confirmed that climate change exists and is caused by human activity.  During the time that the debate as to whether climate change is real, the effects of climate change are continuing to occur and the planet’s condition is worsening.  As stated in the video, the fact that there is no legislature acknowledging climate change will not stop climate change from existing.  
   <br><br>
As someone who strongly believes in climate change, I was curious as to how climate change deniers explained their reason for not believing in climate change given that nearly all scientists have confirmed that climate change is real.  While the video does not go into depth as to how climate change deniers argue about the science, there was a scene where Fred Singer, a climate change denier, was presenting to a conference that intrigued me.  This scene is around the 16:00 minute mark.  Singer is pointing to a graph showing temperature throughout the years and stating that there was no trend indicating that the Earth’s overall temperature was increasing.  While the video follows up this scene with an explanation that data can be manipulated to show no temperature change, it was even clear from the graph that Singer used that there was an overall increase in temperature, yet Singer pointed at it and said there was no trend.
   <br><br>
This video was made to show the arguments of climate change deniers, but it is clearly biased in favor of those who believe in climate change.  I am interested in looking at things from a climate change denier’s point of view to see how they can explain how they can convince so many people to deny something that essentially all scientists have confirmed.

Going through book reviews, a single negative review can make me reconsider whether I should read the book, despite the majority of the reviews being positive. 
   <br><br>
I’m always astounded at how easy it is to attack, but so hard to defend. It’s easy to mess up and destroy, but harder to restore and fix what has been lost. Climate deniers are those who have given up or don’t want to fix problems because it’s easier to deny and deflect blame.
   <br><br>

Ken mentioned that climate deniers don’t come up with their own research. They attack the research of others because it’s easy to prove why others are wrong. It’s much more exciting and easy to disagree than agree with reports. One agreement is one upvote, one like, a mere number that loses significance. One disagreement could be an entire comment chain of argument, which is perfect for what climate deniers want: confusion and delay. Instead of doing their own research, opening themselves up for rebuttal, it’s much more efficient to attack someone else. People focus on the negative because dangers and drama are more interesting and sensational. Climate deniers rely on sensationalism because people will react more to a bold headline than an IPCC report. Climate deniers profit by feeding off of the efforts of climate scientists and activists. Instead of wondering which side is right, people should be directed to focus on the science regardless of how or who is presenting it. Climate change has become a loaded and charged topic with opposing sides when there actually isn’t a debate. 
   <br><br>

A few days ago, I had someone respond to my joke on climate change with: “climate change is not real.” I was shocked because it was the first time that someone my age told me so bluntly. I trust that person and hold them in high esteem, so I still a bit shocked and confused. I want to know why they think climate change isn’t real. Yet, at that time, I stopped myself from starting a debate on climate change because I felt that an argument on climate change, however peaceful or good intentioned wouldn’t be enough to truly change their opinion. I don’t want to see them as a pitiful and misguided person, but it’s just sad that they feel confident enough to say “climate change is not real.” I’m mad that the deceptive tactics have affected people close to me, and ashamed that I cannot change their minds.

<p>
It amazes me how scientific experts deny the reality of climate change because they genuinely believe otherwise from what evidence clearly indicates. For example, in the film, Climate of Doubt, there is a clip in which it showcases a cooling trend for the entire world climate history. These climate crisis deniers have become infatuated with this cooling trend because it could be used as evidence to support their argument that climate change is a made up conspiracy. Yet the trend is indeed false because when zooming out of the graph a more worrisome trend is more noticeable and that is the constant warming of the temperatures throughout the decades. When observing the graph in a brother scale, the  reality is clear. The graph indicates how the temperature is progressively increasing. Experts say that every decade so far has been a new record high of warm temperature that I find concerning but not all that too shocked with the news. Although the evidence is clear and facing them, these deniers still rebuttal the scientific evidence by claiming that the evidence has been tampered with. They go on to say that scientists have purposely altered the numbers to benefit their side of the argument, an incident called the Climategate. Again, even though there were federal investigations that looked into the Climategate scandal and the results were that there weren't any tampering with data. It is quite clear that climate crisis deniers alter the truth to fit their narrative because otherwise they would not have anything to base their arguments on. But as mentioned by Ken in the video, the only thing that these climate change deniers need to do is to provoke doubt within the American people and thus successful dividing the public into believers and nonbelievers. The separation then leads to stagerations which prevents any climate policies from being passed into law. Therefore, the United States is falling behind in environmental policies because there are interest groups like the climate change deniers and fossil fuel companies who will do anything to prevent these policies from being established and enforced.

"A Climate of Doubt" truly depicts the root causes for much of the politics that came up through the rise of climate change as a pressing issue to not only America but the world. Rather than coming together to find a solution of a global problem, the main focus was blurred through claims of false/fake media and inaccuracy of scientists. Even after a study was published where 97-98% of the scientists agreed that humans have played a significant role in the rise of global co2 levels, many "tea-party" groups decided that the other 2% of scientists were more right and that humans have not caused as much of this problem, and some people don't even believe that there is a problem. A great analogy that was used during the movie was arguing that if 98/100 doctors said that the patient should be treated one way and the remaining 2 said that a different treatment is more viable, it is quite the risk to go with the 2% rather than the 98%. This is exactly what has happened with the public in regards to the importance of Climate Change. Additionally, there is major funding from energy companies (mostly those that extract fossil fuels) to stop the belief that these fossil fuels are bad for the environment, confusing the public even more. Essentially, through lobbying and private funding, politicians are able to bend public perception on the issue while politicians enjoy the financial reward of being yes-men to the corporate greed and capitalistic mindset of making as much money as possible, even if it means sacrificing something as big as the world itself.

After watching the video "a climate of doubt". I found it really interested me because the discussion divides into two parts. The first group is scientists, they appeal that people should protect the environment and stop or decrease the pollution to our earth. Their standpoint is to protect the environment, build a better earth and save more resources for our next generations. They provides us scientific data and persuasive reasons. The another group are the companies and the politicians, they basically stand for their benefits. Some non-profitable companies decides to save the resources and more space for the next generations.But the profitable-companies consider about the money they make every year more than everything else. 
   <br><br>

As a student major in Economics, I strong agree with the scientists that appeal us to save the earth. Because if we still do not do anything, the earth would destroy us totally. I think the Australia big fire and the serious disease in Asia is just a warning for us. If the cost of gaining profit is give up the environment resources, I chose to not to, because this is short-sighted. The best choice is to save more resources for our next generations.

The film “Climate of Doubt” is definitely a very educational piece about the history of mass public's response towards the Climate Crisis. Instead of talking about how badly Climate Crisis will affect our future and what should we do about it, we should be educated on how this question is perceived among the citizens of the United States, and what’s the bigger picture behind the issue itself. I like how the professor mentions that it is not a problem about science, but it’s more of a problem about politics and public awareness. Indeed, if there’s something that is agreed on by 97% of the professionals, it would be reckless and futile to tread the water in the opposite direction. Yet I can’t believe there are not only hundreds and thousands, but tens of thousands of well-educated scientists acting in a foolish fashion. The data is lying on the table stone cold, and the science is about it is a sealed case. I believe it is a battle of public awareness and convincing the politicians to fight for these scientists, and this is not something they are very good at. It is already a problem that had evolved out of the laboratory environment. Meanwhile, It is not that simple for all of us and the big companies just suddenly cut carbon emissions. There would be people who are going to be affected by it in different magnitudes, and thus there would be opposition, therefore, it’s not an easy fight to take on. 
   <br><br>

Moreover, I like how this issue draw parallelism to the recent Anti-Vax movement. Both climate change and vaccines’ irrelevance to Autism stands firm in front of scientific authorities. When I think of climate change deniers, they keep reminding myself of Anti-Vax parents, who seek that few pieces of information that probably doesn’t line up in a sea of hard core scientific facts. But coming back to the topic, if we want the whole generation to be rightfully educated on this topic, we have to build up our attention and let the scientific authority speaks for us

Climate change is a very controversial topic for politicians and scientists. The opinions on climate change are so polarizing and come with so much backlash that people are too afraid to voice their opinion. With this fear we are unable to do anything, in the video, the talk of climate change started in 2008 and it is now 2020 and no actual action has been taken. We expect the government to act for what is best for the people but they are too afraid to even mention the topic. How do we expect that the government is going to take action when they are too afraid to start the conversation. It is up the people to take action but they are too afraid that it will affect the economy which it will. But that is something that must happen if we want a future, because the way we are heading has a dark one. Just like the article companies are using their money and resources to mislead the public and make the topic so controversial that no one is will to speak up. The conversation needs to start if we want to see action been done.

As I was watching “a climate of doubt”, I was amazed at the different political perspectives and the different demographic deniers. I was also interested in how they use wrong information to persuade the audience that they neglect climate change and are ignorant  of the outcomes that can possibly care. They focus ideally on the money more than the prospective effects that can occur. Majority comes from fossil fuel companies since they are a major effect of the greenhouse gases and affecting climate change. In addition, campaign reform is a possibility that it will prevent funding from fossil fuel industries to bring more distraction and cause climate change. It is so sad to see how they are narrow minded and focus more on the daily dollar that they can get than actually making a difference to help maintain Earth to its distinguished degree and less natural disasters. The movie also enhances how it is easy to manipulate people to a certain degree to make them confused if climate change is actually affecting the way we live. The deniers are opportunists to persuade the people rather than making a stand. It is also interesting how the both sides the deniers and advocates of climate change are narrow minded and are confident biased. It is sad how we can’t get into agreement on how to control climate change since everyone can sit down and make an agreement.

Though "Merchants of Doubt" was overall a very insightful documentary, I honestly found myself feeling very frustrated, not because of the documentary's overall message, but because of some of the climate change deniers who were interviewed or featured in the film. The most infuriating instance of this in my opinion was when a woman talked about how a bill was up in 2011 which would have changed a rule so that companies no longer had to put pounds of chemicals into their furniture to make it fire resistant. When the the woman talked about a burn doctor who told a story about a baby dying due to burns after her mother put a candle in the crib, but in reality the doctor had completely fabricated several of these stories, I was horrified. However, the worst part was that when asked about it, he simply claimed he wasn't under oath, and wasn't lying. I feel like this serves as a prime example of the way in which companies such as the one that paid this doctor along with oil companies, and automakers have an absurd amount of power due to money and therefore can manipulate so many people. It's a frightening reality. This film really brings to light the way in which our government has continued to fail us in terms of making any type of positive, systemic change to move away from fossil fuels and work to save our planet. While I want to have hope that our future government will do better in terms of climate crisis policies,  all I can do is vote and hope that it's enough to put someone into office who doesn't just say they want to combat climate change, but actually does something about it.

At the beginning of the film "Merchants of Doubt" it began to talk about the tobacco industry and at first I was confused as to what this had to do with the climate crisis; but it soon  made the connection of how the tobacco industry manipulate the consumers to continue buying their product and how the people behind that are the same one's who don't believe in the climate crisis. Which just goes to prove the fact that these people continue to be selfish and I find it disgusting how they could even sacrifice the life of future generations for their own personal gain. They didn't learn from their past mistake of covering up the fact that tobacco was causing many deaths; so now they continue to do the same with the climate crisis. It took 50 years for the tobacco to pay the consequences of their actions; the climate crisis does not have 50 years for the whole world to wake up and realize their mistakes. More over, it's completely frustrating to know that there are people who would rather stay loyal to the non-believer groups just for the fact of being loyal despite the new scientific evidence that is constantly coming out about the climate crisis. On top of that, the NIPCC are so annoying for coping the same exact format of the IPCC climate crisis report and simply just contradicting everything they say; making it impossible for the IPCC report to stand out for congress. They are diabolically ruining the chances of congress hearing the citizens concerns on climate crisis out of spite and denial. I can't believe these kind of people even exist in our world. And because of them we are all suffering.

After watching this film, it was like all the information I got was under deliberate manipulation by some people. And there are so many so-called experts that are actually fake and hypocrites messing my life and selling me the false fact that earth is not experiencing a climate crisis. I am also shocked to see what the big corporations have done to the climate scientists, the congressman, and even civilians. It is too selfish and too irrational for those to do so. After complaining all the way while I watch, I start to contemplate and I start to know that as I dig more into this climate topic, I learn more and I know that the issue is way more complicated than I think. The climate topic is a highly political-related topic; it is a social problem; it is about justice and economics; it is almost about everything from what we know to what we do. The huge secrets of benefits relationship between the politicians, biased scientists, and the big corporations seem so ugly to me. What they are doing is sacrificing the well-being of us who are normal and dutiful citizens for their own sake. I discover the reasonings of why people are inactive or even bored about the climate crisis. It is because of those organizations like American For Properties, so-called think tanks, and clowns on the media and TV who mess up with our minds that try so hard to mislead the public by doing whatever they could. I can't bear Marc Morano says that "he enjoys to unveil and exaggerate the assaulting emails to climate scientists." It is too hard for me to take this since I believe that humanity should stay in unity for the climate crisis and what people like Marc are doing is to break this tie and make fun of those who spend days and nights in the labs just in order to give us an alarm. It is so heartbreaking.

Although a very long film, "Merchant of Doubt" kept me glued to my seat and further deepened my understanding behind the politics of climate change skepticism. Ever since my introduction to the climate crisis, I always thought that climate sceptics or deniers were either worried about the increase in potential taxes, receiving bribes from fossil fuel and coal corporations or just largely undereducated about the climate crisis. However, this film taught me that there are many individuals who don't believe in the climate crisis due to their belief in democracy, and their disdain for any government interventions and potential regulations. Knowing this side of the story, I can finally understand why some people will decidedly reject and twist all the scientific research and facts supporting climate change. Ultimately, it's a battle between facts and belief. Despite such stubborn climate deniers, I found respect for others, such as Michael Shermer and Bob Inglis, who aren't rigid on baseless beliefs and are open to learning about climate change themselves and are willing to side with the facts regardless of their initial standpoints.

After watching Merchants of Doubt, I think it really illustrates what those in power can do to hide the truth. I really liked how they opened the documentary began with a magician and the tobacco industry. It really caught my attention, because I expected the documentary to be about global warming and climate change. Comparing the tobacco industry to what is happening with global warming today was highly effective. Similar to tobacco, climate change is having a detrimental effect on our lives and on the health of this planet. Countless scientists have come up with solid evidence of this fact and have presented about this issue. However, big industries such as the tobacco and oil industries are using their money and power to cover up the issues so they can sell more of their products. This documentary really went into the details of why and how these big industries do this, and after watching, I was really angry about what they were doing. 
    <br><br>
These industries poise as if they are fighting for the people to selfishly promote their own products, and I find that highly disturbing. Climate change, unlike tobacco, is an easier issue for these companies to refute because it is of a science that is harder to understand for the regular person. The effects of climate change on an individual are also not as obvious, and work more slowly than tobacco does. The dangers of climate change comes in the form of natural disasters, and for these companies, it is easy to blame these on the natural changes in weather. I think it is up to the public to realize these truths for ourselves because these companies will not stop trying to change our minds about it. I find it highly unethical for them to be spreading lies like this, but it is completely reasonable that they would do so. It is their job. Thus, the public must find the truth themselves and start making changes without listening to what these big industries are trying to promote. I can only hope that the public will be able to understand these truths before it is too late.

After watching the PBS documentary, Climate of Doubt, I was greatly shocked by the lengths climate change deniers have gone to to debunk the science behind the climate crisis. Ultimately, I concluded that the Heartland Institute and its proponents utilize confusion tactics, confirmation bias, selective statistics, and clever rhetoric to convince vulnerable communities that climate change is a fallacy. 
 
    <br><br>


One of the biggest issues I took with the Heartland institute revolved around their goal of spreading false information regarding the state of the climate to farmers and rural workers in the midwest and southern United States. Their target audience not only produces the majority of the food for the second biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world but greatly contributes to it through methane emissions from livestock herds. Additionally, without access to better resources, environmental education, and funding, these same farms have been exacerbating other environmental issues such as the rapid depletion of the Ogallala aquifer and eutrophication of other freshwater sources due to fertilizer runoff.


    <br><br>


The overarching issue that makes it so easy for low-income rural communities to believe the ideas of climate change deniers, such as the Heartland Institute,  is poverty. As Professor Hiltner says these people are “fighting for their financial needs rather than for the needs of the planet.” It’s impossible to think of providing for future generations when you’re already struggling to make it day-to-day with little room in the budget for much else. Any successful attempt to address climate change must intend to remain mindful of social justice concerns by protecting jobs and providing opportunities to adapt and thrive in a changing economy. This is why I largely support the proposed Green New Deal which would account for individuals and families by guaranteeing jobs, public employment, career training, and universal healthcare.

I cannot agree more on the fact that poverty is the major cause why some low-income families don’t care about and so don’t act upon the climate problem. It is not because of the budget— in fact, poor people contribute much less to carbon emission because they live in smaller houses, they consume less, they tend to use public transportation instead of cars— they just don’t have the energy or attention for this issue as their priority is the financial needs. This is why cap-and-trade could stir anxiety and rage among the middle-class to the low-income households and individuals. The shrinking economy made these people lean to the side of climate change deniers even though the speakers of the side admit to the public that they are no scientists. The economic drawbacks of the environmentally friendly policies leads to a division among the public, and to take back their support, policies need to be revised so that employment, income, and other well-beings are secured. 
    <br><br>


Another thing I felt shock about is the email information request climate scientists received when some of them published an edited chapter or wrote a front page article for a book, being asked to provide all the emails to the American Tradition Institute to “investigate” if there are any internal conversations between scientists that can “prove” that they are manipulating and making up data. While it was the climate change deniers themselves who are changing time frames or endpoints of the data and graphs showing the climate change, the fact that the real scientists are being questioned is ridiculous and truly upsetting as well. It is ironic to hear the climate crisis opposers say that they believe that the claim of climate crisis is not based on science but on political consensus, with scientists involved. It is funny because it sounds like they are describing the group themselves are in.

<p>
  “Merchants of Doubt” did a good job of putting the climate crisis into perspective by comparing it to the tobacco industry and by doing so, many parallels were highlighted between the two. Essentially, the debate between whether smoking kills or not is equivalent to the debate on climate change. Those proposing that there is no scientific consensus on cigarette smoking are being directly benefited by the tobacco industry. As said in the film, the tobacco industry eventually faced consequences for their negligence, but it took 50 years. Climate change is extremely urgent, therefore, we don’t have time to waste and the Earth can’t afford to wait 50 years to see change. Frankly, at this rate, the Earth may be uninhabitable by then. 

    <br><br>

Michael Shermer, the director of The Skeptic Society has my respect because of his openness to learn and look at the data regarding climate change. He was once a skeptic which had nothing to do with data or science, so all he did was look at the data and saw that obviously, the Earth is getting warmer due to human actions. And as he said, “data trumps politics” which I think is important to remember throughout the climate change debate because some people (mostly conservatives) are making the issue solely political when it shouldn’t be. I found Tim Phillips’, the president of Americans for Prosperity, answer to the question about science particularly upsetting because he straight-up admitted to not even looking at the science because he’s “on the economic side of things.” Americans for Prosperity basically believe that due to policies that could be put in place because of climate change the American people will lose their freedom. They’ll no longer be able to live their lives on their terms which is silly when climate change could literally wipe out their home and living situation. I understand that people want their freedom, but when it comes to this debate, it’s inapplicable. Overall, his behavior along with the behavior of Marc Marano and other climate change deniers are sickening and selfish. Climate change isn’t just a Democrat thing, it’s a scientific truth that is present and will continue to destroy our Earth if everyone doesn’t stand up to do something about it. Humans made this mess, so it’s our duty to clean it up.

I agree with your point about the relevancy in the comparison of climate change and the tobacco industry. It's so striking to see the exact same arguments used years ago against legislation to regulate tobacco used now against climate change. At first I was confused about the title "Merchants of Doubt", but quickly understood it to be referencing the people who profit off fabricating arguments to publicize doubt about scientific fact. I was shocked by the doctor in the film who made up "anecdotal" stories about the horrible injury, suffering, and death of infant children to fit his agenda of pushing fire retardants. It's sickening to see the lengths certain people in this film go to in order to make a quick buck through bribery of industries. 
    <br><br>
I was also floored by the "qualifications" of some of the climate change deniers in the film, like that one economics major who "took a few climate classes" in college, so he considers himself more than qualified to debate against climate scientists. It's ridiculously sad that regular people are fooled by these bought-off conmen who are pushing a political or financial agenda over real science. Oil industries are profiting off the politicization of climate change by making it out to be something you can choose to believe in, and tying it to political party affiliation. It's beyond frustrating to see history repeating itself in how long it took for everyone to get on board about cigarettes due to all the manufactured doubt and uncertainty the industries created in order to continue making profits. Climate change is even worse in some ways because it can be harder to see the direct, short-term personal effects. All we can do is keep pushing the facts and hope everyone wakes up to this global danger a little faster.

  It was incredibly frustrating to watch the entirety of "A Climate of Doubt" due to the nature of climate change denial's argumentative methods and the reasons for doing so. 

    <br><br>

Why do climate change deniers deny reasonably certain scientific observations?
    <br><br>


While it is true that many climate change deniers genuinely believe that climate change is a hoax, this film reveals that the source of this belief is the misinformation and doubt spread by several key public figures well-versed in swaying public opinion. Many of these key figures, such as Fred Singer, only push and spread this misinformation due to political leanings and monetary incentives. It is disappointing to see how many conservative representatives have switched from climate change activism to climate change denial in just a few years, not due to any new evidence or any difference in belief, but simply due to political pressure to please large corporations and keep the economy flourishing at the expense of the climate. It is disgusting that political and economic pressures take precedence over science and global safety in the minds of these misinformers and denial publicists.
    <br><br>


So how do these climate change deniers convince the public that scientific facts are false?
    <br><br>


These key public figures that are incentivized to spread misinformation about climate change do so by
    <br><br>
1) Intentionally misrepresenting and twisting real data.
    <br><br>
2) Bribing and pressuring actual scientists to endorse their false claims.
    <br><br>
3) Underplaying the severity of the issue if they must admit there is one.
    <br><br>
4) Claiming climate change activists have ulterior sinister motives that are loosely connected to climate change policy action.
    <br><br>
It is disgusting that climate change deniers resort to these underhanded, intentionally malignant methods of spreading misinformation purely due to political and economic pressures. The lives of future generations should not have to be condemned for the sake of current luxuries and money. It's lives against greed, and greed is winning.

  After watching "Climate of Doubt" about a year ago, I was excited to see what the film "Merchants of Doubt" would bring to the table. This film was captivating to watch and I really enjoyed the allusions to magic and the trickery behind it used as a theme throughout. It was also very interesting to me, as someone who grew up at a time when cigarettes were already widely unpopular, restricted and known to cause serious health risks, to see how that debate around cigarettes and smoking unfolded. I did not know the lengths to which tobacco companies went to keep their products selling and the many backwards mechanisms that allowed them to lie to the public for so long. It really does align perfectly with the climate crisis, and the same people who worked for Big Tobacco in creating doubt around this issue went on to work on the skeptic side of many environmental issues. Knowing that people make a career out of spreading misinformation and pride themselves in their ability to do makes me sick. 
    <br><br>

It was noted during the breakdown of the fight to remove toxic flame retardants in furniture that tobacco companies were responding to the great number of cigarette-related fires and resulting deaths with the argument: "you need to fireproof the world around the cigarette." This sounds ridiculous in this case, which it is, but it also reminded me of some responses to climate change. Rather than recognize the root issue and attempt to solve or get rid of it, people all over the world are trying to treat the symptoms, often without connecting it to the correct cause. Going back to last week, this reminded me of Trump's response to the Paradise Fire. What we know is a climate change-caused event was argued to have been a result of not clearing away enough brush in California. So, efforts that should go towards limiting emissions or slowing climate change is instead directed towards pseudo-issues like clearing brush.

  After watching "A Climate of Doubt," it feels as if we lost a good opportunity to make progress on the climate crisis. 12 years ago, Barrack Obama aimed to implement a cap and trade system, which would have set the US on the right foot in leading the world on the issue of climate change. Around that time, there seemed to be a general consensus between both Republicans and Democrats on the science. Yet, Obama's cap and trade system never made it through the senate. Somewhere between when cap and trade was introduced and when it failed, there was a shift in the public's ideology -- a very odd shift. Those who once believed simply changed their minds. The film showed clips of people like Mitt Romney changing their minds on the issue very quickly. My assumption is that large fossil fuels industries began to realize how these pro-environment movements would drastically impact their profits, so they began to use their money to infiltrate cracks in the government. I can't think of any other way why people would change their mind on the topic so quickly when, as time goes on, the evidence becomes more and more clear.
    <br><br>

Another thing that caught my attention in "A Climate of Doubt" was how these skeptics talked. It felt as if these people were lying straight through their teeth -- Fred Singer in particular. The way he talked about the issue just felt off. He kept his answers very short -- just a word or two. He acknowledged the fact that he labeled a bunch of unqualified people as "scientists" in a document, yet just ignored it. It might be a stretch and it's most likely due to the fact that I know he is wrong, but it was definitely something I noticed.
    <br><br>

In the end, this film left me frustrated more than anything. Again, it felt like a lost opportunity. It left me hating all the deniers featured in the film. But most importantly, it opened my eyes to how deceitful government officials can be, especially on the topic of the climate crisis.

  As I watched the film “A Climate of doubt,” I was impressed by the way climate “skeptics” communicated their messages. The first thing that really shocked me about the this film was when Christopher Monkton said “the right response to the non-problem of global warming — first slide, please — is to have the courage to do nothing.” Our planet is warming and thus dying, we can’t have the courage to let it die. We just can’t have the courage to not protect what has long protected us and has given us life.Also, the fact that they say“We got up a hot-air balloon, put a banner on the side of it that said, ‘Cap-and-trade means higher taxes, lost jobs, less freedom.’” Is ridiculous because if we let the climate crisis continue, the outcome will be worst, there will not only be zero jobs but zero of everything we have.” It also makes me mad to hear that there are people out there messing with scientific data just to show that the earth is not warming. How can people have the will to do such things. 
     <br><br>

I feel that everything that these skeptics are doing is a danger to public opinion. Fossil fuel companies are trying to change our point of view by convincing us of discrediting the science that supports climate change. It is like they are changing the story for us. For people who do believe in climate change, being told facts that against what they believe can alter their way of thinking and affect the number of people that want to do something about climate change. What is worst is that it makes it hard to believe what science is true and diminishes the trust we have on scientists.

I agree with you that watching “A Climate of Doubt” impressed me because of how these scientists were able to be so convincing. It is hard to imagine that such educated people don’t believe in climate change and that they use their platform to protect fossil fuel companies. The fact that they think we shouldn’t do anything what is going on with our planet is frightening. There is no way that we can just wait for these problems to solve themselves. We have to act now to ensure that we won’t have anymore everlasting effects. The problem is that these scientists and influential believe that climate change is a disservice to them. These people are able to convince masses of people to oppose politicians who are trying to make change. They would rather not be taxed than save our planet. How can these people care so much about money if, one day, there won’t be anything left for anyone. All that we will be left with are disasters. It is frustrating that the more people who believe that climate change is a hoax, the harder it will be to make a change. This film shows how ignorant people, especially in America, are to what is going on. The advocates for the Heartland Institute and similar organizations promote a platform based on denying climate change. This shows how fossil fuel companies take advantage of the lower classes and provide them a convenient life, rather than one that will be better for our planet, just so that they can keep the money coming in.

  It was interesting to see the perspective of climate deniers within the political party. Before watching this documentary, I could not fathom what kind of arguments they could make. And while watching it, I began to feel more confused. Despite scientists providing clear connections between humans and global warming, skeptic politicians continued to deny every fact. Fred Singer, a retired physicist, and a speaker for those skeptics states that "the climate needs no help from humans." Hearing this, I felt intense frustration. While I understand that this film came out in 2012, there were already so many scientists and statistics backing up the fact that climate change is real. Now in 2020, I am witnessing its consequences and it makes me wonder if they would have taken it more seriously had they seen what I have. This documentary felt like a debate between scientists and politicians; a debate on different priorities. It was obvious that politicians continued to deny climate change's legitimacy due to economic reasons, while scientists were looking to the earth's and humanity's future. It was even explained that these skeptics borrowed tactics from tobacco companies to introduce arguments against anthropogenic climate change.
     <br><br>

Close to the end of the film, there is an emphasis on sea-level risings and its indication of the inconvenient truth. "The ocean's going to win." Hearing this statement, and actually witnessing the negative effects that climate change is creating in my years, I feel fear. While it almost was satisfying to see that the scientists were right and that the politicians should've listened to them, it is also saddening that it has come to that point.

  After having watched both films, "Merchants of Doubt" was even more frustrating than "A Climate of Doubt," something I thought couldn't be possible. I really like how "Merchants of Doubt" makes the comparison of tobacco companies to climate deniers because they are one in the same; criminal, mean, usually rich, and politically motivated in the end. People have known since the 50s that cigarettes caused cancer, just as scientist have known the detriments of CO2 in the atmosphere for over a century. In regards to the fire retardant scandal, if you can even call it a fire retardant, they were using chemicals they knew were harmful to humans yet kept the supply going purely for money. The man who falsely testified about the candle burned babies was even more disturbing.
     <br><br>
In the beginning of the film, Stan Glantz said, "One thing you've gotta be willing to do when you're doing science that is not in the interest of these giant corporations, when people come after you for baloney reasons, you've gotta be willing to stand up to them." We can't back down to these companies or front groups they financially support, scientists have the facts and data that proves these people are fake and just money-hungry. It's truly a sickening agenda. The way these companies have invented ways to brainwash people into doubt over real data is so mind-boggling to me. These companies, like Exxon or Heartland Institute, don't want to lose and will do anything to keep their selfish ways going. 
     <br><br>
I still cannot wrap my head around how climatologists or environmentalists can be described as "politically motivated" when it is known that these huge companies and conventions they fund are primarily based around politics. They don't want more government regulation because they know they will lose money so they use the term "freedom" and wave it around people's faces because they know it will anger and motivate conservatives to follow the climate deniers. Fred Seitz, who worked for tobacco companies, was a physicist and Cold War scientist who led a climate denier convention. He discredits scientists who have credentials in environmental fields because he says he can and the only thing he had to back it up in the film was to say "they're just wrong, that's it." Everything these people say contradicts themselves. At one point environmental scientists don't specialize in every subject so they can't be credible sources, but how can someone like Fred be credible if he doesn't have any credentials to even do with climate or the environment???? And what about people who don't even know anything about science in the first place like Marc Morano???? This was the most aggravating aspect for me. People like Marc Morano who like to make fun of and discredit scientists for the "fun" of it don't make sense to me and what they say shouldn't even be in this "debate". Everything will catch up to these people just like the cigarette companies.
     <br><br>
The only thing that gave me hope were the conservatives at the end who believe in climate change because they actually took the time to look at data and put their political opinions to the side for the good of our planet.

<p>
  
  After watching "A Climate of Doubt" I was in shock listening to many of the climate deniers and it made me curious about what information and data they are observing to draw these conclusions. As the documentary mentioned its easy to show cooling but just changing the range of the date which makes sense for a majority of these conclusions. One thing that really hit me, was when the documentary mentioned that in the end "the ocean will win" which I believe is insanely important to understand. For any climate deniers, they may be able to fool people and mislead the population towards the idea that climate is not an urgent issue but in the end, the ocean will be the one to speak the truth to the nation. You can't ignore it's rising voice. 

     <br><br>

American voters are truly lazy and many don't take the time to do research on certain issues and instead rely on other people to feed them the facts. People remain blind and unable to distinguish between the lies and the truth. Because of this fact, climate deniers have been able to grow such an overwhelming support system because of their ability to make themselves look like the good guys. One thing that really upset me, was a section of the documentary when a woman said "they call it pollution, we call it life" focusing on the aspect that for many people, the climate crisis is painted as too broad of a picture and they don't see a near future in which it will affect their own lives.  I'm really glad I was able to watch this documentary and get a little bit of insight into what is really out there, information-wise, on the climate denier side of the climate crisis.

I 100% agree with Shianne, the idea that Americans are relying on others to make their judgments makes me really uncomfortable especially when you consider that the people they rely upon are not scientifically based and often times are easily swayed due to monetary transactions. I always knew that there were people who didn't believe in Climate Change, but I never really knew why or what they based their opinion on. After watching this documentary, I still can't really understand where these people are getting their information and honestly speaking, that is terrifying. Like Shianne, I believe this is mainly down to the idea that Americans are becoming lazy and only seek information that won't disturb their normal nine to five lives because then they wouldn't have the opportunity to be as lazy as they would like to be. 
     <br><br>

Another thing that I also really agreed with what Shianne said was that in the end, the ocean will win, its not a question, it is a statement. For all these efforts to combat the movement trying to limit climate change, it really won't matter in the end. Climate change is happening and these critics and nonbelievers will be there to face the wrath of the climate if efforts to stop it don't become more and more progressive. Yes, climate change is changing life as we know it however our duty isn't to pretend it's not there or won't affect us, its to act and protect the only home we have.
      <br><hr>
      After watching “A Climate of Doubt,” I couldn’t agree more with how you put this. The thing that stood out to me the most in the documentary was also the part in which they stated that in the end “the ocean will win”. Living on the west coast so close to the ocean in Santa Barbara and at home in San Diego, the ocean has always been a huge concern of mine and of my community’s. Out of all of the environmental changes I have seen being made around me, the ones that always have the most participation, influence, and success are the ones having to do with the ocean. Although a selfish part of the problem, rising sea levels threaten many people’s living situations, and people have noticed this change already coming. We have also seen warming climates and water temperature threaten sea life and entire marine ecosystems that the ocean depends on. We have been watching the ocean dying, and whether or not people have been worrying about all of the effects of the climate crisis, people have been worrying about this. Soon, people like us who live on the coast will not be the only ones witnessing the effects of the climate change on our oceans, and “the ocean will win” in communicating the message of climate emergency. In America, voter prevalence still lies within the older range of citizens, and the remaining population of young minds usually are not participating in the voting process of aiding the planet. These young minds are the ones whose minds are most clearly aware of the threat of climate change, and they need to be voting. Either way, most voters are lazy, like you  said, and this has a huge impact on distinguishing fact from lies meant to persuade people into confusion or disbelief given that many will not take the proper time to research this issue. This must change, and I think the easiest way to start is by targeting the upcoming young population of voters with simplified yet secure messages about the climate crisis.

  After watching “Climate of Change,” I became very annoyed with the way in which many conservative politicians treat the climate debate as a game. As mentioned in the documentary, climate skeptics fear the “leftist agenda underlying the climate movement.” In my opinion, politicians in denial of climate change seem to use the threat of “underlying political motives from the left” as an excuse to ignore legitimate scientific research and findings proving human actions to be the leading cause of global warming. The idea that policy is more important than the science itself has allowed climate deniers to gain support from their constituents. Once the public becomes skeptical of human impact on the climate, they may just side with the policies that won’t hurt them financially or damage the convenience of their lives, especially if they haven’t previously cared about the environment. This is dangerous; in the United States, the voting public is not very involved, and if skepticism is introduced, they might not care enough to research the subject themselves.
     <br><br>

Although the documentary did a good job exhibiting climate deniers’ opinions with a seemingly unbiased view, it was still very frustrating to listen to what they had to say. Even after listening to their “logic and reasoning” behind their denial of anthropogenic climate change, I still believe that these people are fighting in a battle that they shouldn’t win. Climate deniers should be struggling to have a voice in this debate, but through careful wording, political attacks on climate science, and big industries on their side, they seem to have the upperhand. With an issue as pressing as the climate crisis, evidence of anthropogenic impacts on the environment should be enough, but scientific fact is constantly challenged by politically motivated opinion.

I watched this film with a friend of mine who’s also in English 23 and we would laugh and mock everytime an old white conservative said something arguing against climate change. I would agree with you Leah, that these conservative politicians treat climate change as a game, pushing only their agenda forward. These anti-climate change conferences are a joke. One of the members, during the interview, was asked how he could go against all the facts scientists have proven and he called scientists liars. These people seem so ignorant. I was especially annoyed when people were calling climate change a fallacy. How can people argue that climate change is “a mistaken belief, especially one based on unsound argument” (the definition of a fallacy) when there is so many facts and statistics to prove differently. These two sides of climate change has left the masses confused and unaware about the truths of climate change. I’d agree with you again Leah, that this will play a large role when it comes to voting. The lack of climate change education will cause people to vote for those in favor of big businesses and money rather than those who are trying to raise the issues of climate change. 
     <br><br>

This movie was my least favorite out of the three we’ve watched. Not only was the content annoying but it was overall not entertaining and not good at pushing forward the issues of climate change. It’s crazy to me that people could be so foolish enough to believe these climate change deniers or worse yet that people are dumb enough to be the climate change deniers.

  I found this episode quite frustrating. As one of the interviewees mentioned, I do too believe, “they are all professional contrarians”. I found Fred Singer’s comment about nothing being wrong with the climate quite absurd. He also mentioned that it will keep changing and that we just have to wait. But the question is, wait for what? For the contrarians themselves to be proved wrong?
     <br><br>
In my opinion their arguments aren’t really doing much other than convincing the public to fight against the scientists. What I found quite interesting was the discussion about the Global Surface Temperature Change chart. If you take the whole chart you can see that the temperature has been rising, but you can also take a piece of it and pick any end points to mark a ‘cooling period’. This was just very interesting because they’ve mastered to manipulate data to support their arguments. 
     <br><br>
I was quite skeptical on how they obtained to have many supporters against the idea that human activity is causing climate change. For what their responses were during the interviews, I wouldn’t confide in any them. They said it themselves that they don’t have any scientific qualifications nor are doing their own research. Yet they still use scientific data that has already been published and still choose to go against the idea. They are only leading the people to a disastrous period because of their lack of awareness.

I also thought that Fred Singer’s comment about how “nothing is wrong with the climate” to be quite unreasonable; even if one does not think that climate change is caused anthropogenically, it is quite obvious that something is wrong with our climate. Increasing temperatures, rising sea levels and ocean acidification, increased frequency and severity of natural disasters… it is truly ludicrous to believe that there is NOTHING wrong with our climate. Whether you believe it is anthropogenically caused or naturally caused, there is an undeniable problem that is decreasing the quality of life for all of earth’s creatures, not just humans. 
      <br><br>

Throughout watching “A Climate of Doubt”, my main emotion was shock. I always knew that there were climate change deniers, but I was not aware that there were so many climate-change-denying scientists. 
      <br><br>

It makes more sense now that so many people doubt that climate change is occurring. If there are two equally credible scientists on either side of the situation, people are obviously going to choose to believe the side that is easier to handle. The side that puts less blame on ourselves, and that requires less action (or in this case, no action at all). People will believe what they want to believe, but it is all the more difficult to distinguish fact from fiction when there are (at least what seem to be) credible people supporting each side.
      <br><br>

What really irks me is the fact that these climate change deniers are not only persuading people into believing that there is no problem, but are also making it more difficult for everyone who DOES know that there is a problem to lay the foundations for change. It is a sad reality that we will never be able to get the entire world to work together on this issue, but we need as many people to support it as possible. Instead of actively trying to convince people that climate change is not an issue, why not just be quiet? Why not just sit back and be lazy like they were already doing? By fighting against climate change activists, there no good is promised from the situation; only a very likely possibility of further destruction. But letting climate change activists “do their thing” promises no negative outcomes, only a potentially life-saving outcome. If people cannot see the evidence that WE are causing climate change and that it IS a crisis, then they should just step back and let us do our work. They can thank us later.

  After watching the film “A Climate of Doubt”, I now understand how climate change is involved in politics. Before watching the film, I never understood why political parties would deny climate change, but now I do. It seems to be all about the money. The whole economic collapse in 2008 seemed to really change the momentum for climate change activist. When the economy plummeted, politicians seized the opportunity to convince the public about how climate change is a hoax, which is not ;). People believed this because they saw it happen, they experienced it. This makes me believe that people will admit climate change is real when something catastrophic happens to them personally. It sucks to say this but look at what happened to the people in Paradise, CA. I just hope the people who do not believe in climate change come to their senses before it is too late. We still have time to help our planet and fight climate change the best way we can. I do not want the people from North Carolina to believe in climate change when their home is underwater, or any coastal city. Let us take advantage of the time we have before it is too late.

  Watching A Climate of Doubt was interesting in the sense that it allowed me to see the perspective of the so-called climate skeptics. Honestly, this movie was so annoying to watch because it is a clear depiction of how corrupt American politics are. It is so incredibly frustrating to me to see how easily people are convinced into not caring about environmental issues. I remember in one part of the movie, a leader of the free market group said something along the lines of “If you can control the policy, you can control the science”. This comment really stood out to me because of how truthful it is — the skeptics don’t need to convince anyone that the science isn’t true, as long as they can confuse the public enough to not take action, they are winning. The most upsetting thing about this though is the amount of politicians that have joined the skeptic side — not because they don’t think climate change is happening, but because of the negative image that those who advocate for climate change have. Politics in our American democracy has become a performance: politicians claim to care about their party, but in reality, they will only do and say what is in their own best interest. It is unfortunate that this fossil-fuel economy has led to a culture of ignorance, led by the hands of corporate greed. As Ken said, it is only a matter of time until the effects of climate change become so widespread that the people will begin to see the truth. However, considering how Australia’s own prime minister still denying the climate crisis in the midst of their entire country being on fire is concerning. I wonder how much disaster needs to occur before the conservatives in power will finally admit there is a problem.

I also found how easily people were convinced quite frustrating. If we think about the skeptics' purpose, it is only to draw the public away from the environmental issues. They do well in advertising and advocating against climate change because they hold the power to 'control policy' as you mentioned. I also agree with your statement about how many politicians have joined the skeptics because of the negative image they have created for those who advocate for climate change; one of the interviewees gave an example of this. She mentioned that Fred Upton, the Chairman of House Energy committee once had 
      <br><br>
“climate change is a problem” on his website and had taken it off. This also shows the control the skeptics have on denying the issue. It will be difficult for them to see the truth if they continue to fight against the scientists. I also question how much more disastrous events need to happen for them to finally admit that climate change is a problem.
<br><Hr>
I completely agree with Michelle. I think it is infuriating to watch just how corrupt politicians are, even with an issue that is so delicate as the climate crisis. Politicians and businessmen are working together in order to convince the general public that climate change is not real, and that we are not living in a crisis. I think that this is outrageous as the science clearly shows that the Earth is continuously getting warmer through the decades and we are aware of the serious consequences that the continuous warming of our planet can have on human life on Earth, not to mention the impact it would have on wildlife. We see how certain scientists work together with big companies such as Exxon in order to convince people that climate change is not real. Exxon claimed that all the CO2 in the atmosphere is simply life and it does not have an impact on our planet warming. This to me is just infuriating because the only reason Exxon wants people to believe that humans don't have an impact on climate change because they are in the business of burning fossil fuels. If people were to realize that the burning of fossil fuels is bad for the environment, it would affect Exxon's profit. To me the fact that companies and scientists are willing to disregard the facts of something that has an impact on our planet so greatly is completely ridiculous.

It really is concerning how effective these people are in swaying public opinion. Much like the article we had to read this week, the author was so effective in making the argument seem as if it were from an unbiased third party. Of course, this isn't the case. The majority of climate change deniers are definitely politically motivated in advocating for the things that they do. I feel like, as long as the politicians succeed in confusing the public, they're doing their job. The motivation isn't to coerce that their side is right, it is to coerce the public that the opposition (climate change alarmists) are wrong. If they succeed in doing so, like you said, people are likely to develop a negative image of climate change alarmists, and as a result, will be much less likely to follow the initiative. I also believe you pick the perfect quote from the film  to encapsulate the current state of American politics. It almost seems as if certain people have the power to manipulate almost anything they want which is genuinely concerning for our future.

<br><Hr>
The most striking statement in a Climate of Doubt is definitely "If you can control the policy, you can control the science," as you said.  There is an interesting parallel with Merchants of Doubt, that really demonstrates the American public is purposefully mislead about glaring truths.  There is essentially nothing the public can do, but bend to the whim of policy makers and corporations. It is a bleak fate but it seems that as long as we are a consumer based republic, the most power will always lie with those who control policy and those who distribute the goods we are so accostumed to loving. Do you think there is any politician or any number of politicians who could reserve the dangerous trajectory? If they attempt to do so would their peers let them get away with it? A tiny beam of hope is that the general public largely cannot be blamed.  Humans are creatures of habit and adaptation, it is difficult to fight or question appointed authority.    Big businesses know this and use it to their advantage. The tobacco industry acted as a supreme evil force by exploiting their power at the expense of the health of the public.  Merchants of Doubt showcases how big tobacco flooded the world with their propaganda and money.  The money drowned out the voices of the public, as it tends to do.  There is far too much at stake to let personal interest come before billions of lives and a whole biosphere of natural life.  Is there any way we can stop big business from getting away with their practices?

  In the film "Climate of Doubt", it really frustrates me how stubborn deniers are. They will die denying that climate change is a real. It really makes me angry how these ignorant people really think they know more than actual scientists. I hate the power these people have within our government. Money really is power. They are paying for nothing to be done. I don't know what to be more disappointed about. the fact that people like that have so much power or the fact our politicians will take their money and practically be their little puppet. I wish politicians would do what is right for the people rather than their pockets. It's all about the money. Politicians make a mockery of modern science.  I hope these people open their eyes and see the reality we live in.

  I enjoyed the film. I think the director is very smart and interesting to use the magician as a guideline of how the Fossil Fuel Industry tries to fool the audience. I love the theme that it is convincing. Once the tricks are revealed, the lie isn’t a lie anymore. You will be able to reveal it again and again. The important thing is the process of revealing. It will be tedious because scientists have to repeatedly tell the same truth and there will be people who try to cast doubt to people and there will be people who “sleep.” This is why I appreciate and respect those scientists who keep trying and never give up to convince more and more to believe in climate change and immediate actions are important. 
      <br><br>

When Professor Ken mentioned that 88 percent of the fossil fuel has to be reserved, I suddenly realized that all those severe climate disasters, such as Thomas Fire and Flood, are only caused by burning a small portion of the fossil fuels. The video also said that the fossil fuel industry is trying to take control of the fossil fuel of the Earth as much as possible. It is hard to imagine the consequences of them digging out more fossil fuels and burn them. Now, only 12 percent are off the ground. If more fossil fuels are dug out, that will be a hell, and that will be an extinction. Actions are important!

  One point I really liked from “Merchants of Doubt” was the comparison between the tobacco industry and climate crisis deniers. I didn’t know the history of the tobacco industry, and it came as a really big shock that at one point, there were many debates about whether or not tobacco is really harmful for your health. Just like the Heartland Institute, the tobacco industry used their money and power to spread enough doubt to make smoking a controversial topic. And just like the current fossil fuel industries, the tobacco industry was smart enough to make consumers question scientists’ claims. To people in my generation, it seems absurd that there were people at one point who doubted the health effects of smoking, but I can see how that applies to the current issue of the climate crisis. Although science says that the climate crisis is real, powerful corporations are able to generate enough questions to make climate deniers stubborn in their beliefs. Hopefully, the next generation will also look back and question how there ever was so much controversy around the topic of climate change- just like how we question how smoking was once so controversial.

What shocked me most when watching “Merchants of Doubt” was learning how closely related several issues are, including tobacco use, the use of flame retardants, and the climate crisis. Not only do these issues all involve a group like Big Tobacco or the oil industry who are interested in suppressing scientific truth to further their business, these issues in some cases involve the same exact people doing the suppressing. As I have learned, the art of reframing scientific truth to fit one’s own needs is itself a business.
      <br><br>
Your comment actually gives me hope, as it’s very possible that someday soon a new generation will be watching a documentary about the suppression of climate change truths and be completely baffled at how there was once even a debate on the matter, as we feel now learning about Big Tobacco’s efforts to cause doubt around the science of smoking. In that near future the government and the public will view fossil fuel use as the poison that it is to our planet, as we view cigarettes being poison to our lungs.

 "Merchants Of Doubt" elicited its argument by comparing the tobacco companies' and oil companies' tricks to magic. It pointed out that oil companies are cheating the public by blurring their opinion away from climate change. What oil companies have done is analogical to tobacco companies done in 20 century. Tobacco companies have known that Nicotine is addictive and smoking is harmful to the human body since 1960, but they did not tell the truth to the public, and when they are asked to tell whether smoking is harmful, they said that it is unclear whether tobacco is harmful to human. Oild companies are doing the same thing by connecting climate change to liberty. Furthermore, climate change deniers highlight that environmentalists and environmental movements are communism. Therefore, the public is confused about the truth of climate change. However, as Ken mentioned in the lecture that the more time we spend on debating whether climate change is anthropogenic, the more oil will be extracted by oil companies. 
         <br><br>
  In my perspective, it is truly a political debate rather than a scientific debate. Just like the documentary emphasized, most deniers are not really categorized as scientists. On the other hand, they are deniers who are physicalists that did not judge climate change through their knowledge but through their bias. They experienced the Cold war, so they are extremely antipathetic to socialism, and they believe that government regulation is a kind of socialism. Hence, they are antipathetic to the environmentalism, too. However, climate change can not be mitigated without government regulation, so the debate will not end until climate change is counteracted.

  In the documentary "Merchants of Doubt", the documentary tells how tobacco companies conceal the harmful effects of tobacco on the human body in order to obtain benefits, leading to the fact that some companies and people have hidden global warming for their own benefit, or deliberately fabricated evidence that the climate is not warming. Moreover, the documentary states that in the public eye, people usually speak not for science, but for political science. The content of the speech is even closely related to its own position.
         <br><br>

I feel very sad about this. For the sake of their own interests, people cannot tell the truth of the matter. These people are at the same time repulsive, but also pitiful. It can be seen how difficult it is to say what you really want to say when you are more than yourself. And those who are used to tell the truth, how precious and worthy of respect.
         <br><br>
I understand that some people cannot tell the fact that global warming is happening for various reasons, but the public should see the truth, that is, global warming is happening irreversibly. If we don't take action, then everything will get worse.
         <br><br>

"Merchants of Doubt" is worth watching. If I rate this documentary, I will give  4 out of 5. It reveals the dark side of people, letting us know that the information is not completely true.

  After watching of "Climate of Doubt," I believe climate change should not be a PARTISAN issue, but it absolutely is a political one. I am of the opinion that the personal is political, and our lives are deeply impacted by all levels of government. In the same way that climate change seems too big to impact us individually, people often think this about the federal government and their laws and regulations. While I think that true change stems from small grassroots movements, it also has to make it up to the federal level to have a wider impact. Unfortunately, it seems like organizations such as AFP and the Heartland Institute have realized this before climate activist groups have. While science is needed to convince people, money is needed to convince the politicians that influence us because of the corrupt impacts of lobbying and campaign donations on our political systems.
         <br><br>

The only way, in my opinion, to erode the influence of climate change deniers on our political system is to either go through the courts to somehow overturn the ability of large corporations to act as people and use their money as freedom of speech, or find climate-activist political action groups with significant financial influence to sway politicians in a similar way these right-leaning groups have. I feel that by continuing to lean on the science and gaining the public support of both left and right leaning politicians, we can begin to turn the tide against groups that espouse anti-science rhetoric and prevent their political influence from growing stronger. I also feel that somehow preventing donation of "quiet money" through groups such as Donors Trust would help in the prevention of blatant denial of scientific evidence, but I understand how organizations like this can be defended as protecting the privacy of the American people (or corporations, which in my opinion, are NOT people).

  The film, A Climate of Doubt, focus on the most influential topic in nowadays society - global warming.  The film begins with interviews of anti-climate change people who claim that climate change has nothing to do with human activity. Fred Singer, who is an anti-climate change physicist, believes that "Science is hyped on global warming." He said, "global warming is a phantom issue". However, most of these anti-climate change people barely done any research on climate. Through data analysis on temperature, 97 percent of scientists concluded that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is mostly the cause of global warming. The reason why 3% of scientists ignore the scientific fact is because of political interest.
         <br><br>

I would definitely recommend this film to my friends because it's our responsibility to aware of this issue and to protect our planet.

<p>
  The film "Climate of Doubt" provides me a brand new perspective about climate change. I used to think that human behavior causing climate change is an undeniable fact, but this film gives me the thought of those opponents. Just like Fred Singer's idea, many opponents believe climate change or global warming isn't an issue and it will change automatically no matter what we do. However, Fred Singer's statement has many faults pointed by scientists. When he claims no warming in the last ten years, climate scientists argue that he is just playing a game of date. I don't know why Fred Singer is hiding the truth, but I understand why normal citizens are willing to stand by his side since admitting the climate change will lead to a tremendous impact on their current life. Therefore, citizens are willing to avoid the issue of global warming with the excuse that there is nothing wrong with climate. But, in my view, human should face this problem as soon as possible, because we only have one Earth and don't want to leave this messy situation to our descendants.

Hi! Yes I agree with you, I also got a little bit more of an understanding of how people deny climate change when watching this film. Before watching this I really didn't understand how people could say climate change isn't real or is not impacted by humans. I found it interesting to actually see that scientists can simulate statistics and numbers that say that temperatures are going down even though this is not true. For some of the general population this would be very confusing to see. With that said, I also found comments about how climate will change no matter what and "we just have to wait" from Singer extremely aggravating. Wait for what? For how long? When do we admit that we have done something horrible to our planet and we need to change it before it's too late? This just makes me ask, do these educated people that are saying climate change is not an issue really believe that? Because in my eyes they have to know that it is an issue.



</span></div><hr>



<p>
  While watching this film I wanted to laugh. The people claiming that we had nothing to worry about, in my opinion, are so ignorant. For example, Fred Singer said, “In the last 10 years, there hasn't been a warming. We don't know why that is. But one doesn't see any warming in the observations. There simply is no trend.” If you look at any data created by any actual climate scientist there is obviously a warming trend. Climate scientist, Andrew Dessler also explained that you could create your own graph and carefully pick out points to make it seem as if we have nothing to worry about. This means that anyone can create a graph and take it to the convention to show people that the climate is fine and stable. 
         <br><br>
This film also made me embarrassed for our country. There are many other countries working hard and coming up with ways they can combat the climate crisis, while our government is paid by fossil fuel companies to lie and deny. The frustrating thing is that the people in our government won’t be around when climate change gets really bad. They won’t have to deal with the consequences and mistakes that they made. The younger generations will. My generation will be responsible for picking up the broken pieces and for figuring out what to do next.

  A part of this film that I feel like had great implications for the entire climate crisis skeptics was when Lord Monckton was speaking at the “Take America Back” conference. Starting off with the comment that he was introduced as a professional wrestler really set the tone for this speech. Comparing this intro to a wrestling intro really took away any respect or legitimacy to this situation. Right after this the voiceover explains how this man admits that he has absolutely no scientific qualifications. I found this part comical almost laughing out loud at how ridiculous this situation was. They get this well dressed man with a nice accent to powerfully say anything at all with absolutely no facts presented and the crowd eats it up. It becomes a mob mentality of repeating the words of this figure who truly had no grounds that would prompt people to follow him. Yet, when actual scientists and educated people give the facts and numbers of the climate change that is actually happening, these people look it off as a hoax. I think it's so ironic that the crowd begins chanting USA and waving flags for this cause as it is our country that is in danger and they are the ones doing their country a great disservice. This miss-placed nationalism is embarrassing and makes our country look ignorant and complacent. 
         <br><br>
The Oregon petition was just one example that stood out to me of the deceptive data that these skeptics are standing behind. The fact that anyone with a bachelor's degree of science could sign this petition and then Singer to go and say that they are all scientists and is just completely false. He is trying to argue that many more scientists than the mere 3% on oh his side when they are clearly not.

<p>
  
  After watching the film "A Climate of Doubt", I finally got to understand the mindset and history of the people who do not believe in climate change. It is interesting that despite all of the scientific evidence pointing towards a warming earth, there are still people who refuse to believe so. Most of the information that these scientists pose are believable and extremely clear. There should really be no dispute as to whether they are right or wrong. In my opinion, it's better to be safe than sorry in this situation. Most of the time, scientific evidence should be straightforward and trusted. But, if for some reason it isn't, there still is no excuse as to why people aren't acting. Maybe tests and studies may not have a concrete effect, but if they don't, then just the sights of ice caps melting, animals going extinct, and the air pollution around us (it is very prominent in LA, you cannot miss it) should cause some sort of concern in people. There really is no reason not to want to take action because evidence is around us if scientific evidence is not well received.

 I agree with your statement that it is better to be safe than sorry.  It reminds me of a political cartoon I saw that had a list of things that we could do to lessen the effects of climate change, better education, eating a largely plant-based diet, etc. A person asked "what if it's all fake, what is climate change isn't real?" The cartoon answered with "Then we made a better planet for our children anyway."  It really struck me, even if we do all of these changes and it turns out that climate change is independent of human activity (which is unlikely), our planet will still have been changed for the better. 
         <br><br>

 It angered me to see how political this issue has grown to be.  Many scientists and politicians have been bought out by the same companies that profit off of climate change.  After watching "A Climate of Doubt," I realized that we are not the target audience for this type of documentary.  They are not trying to change the mind of deniers and they are not offering solutions for those who acknowledge the issue. The point of this documentary is to sway the audience that is on the fence, and I really hope it swayed them in the right direction.

</span></div><hr>


<p>
  The topic of climate change is highly debated and highly divided, when it shouldn't be; climate change is a reality and its effects are approaching quickly. It baffles me that people still don't believe this and it shocks me even more to see people forming groups that claim that climate change is a hoax. The film A Climate of Doubt focuses on organizations that work to push an agenda of portraying climate change as a hoax. Organizations such as the Americans For Prosperity Foundation (AFP) and the Heartland Institute are dangerous because they wield enormous power. Organizations such as these are backed by millions of dollars from oil companies that don’t want stronger regulations put in place to act on climate change. It is even more dangerous when scientists analyze data in a way that makes it appear as though the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is interpreted as increasing at a normal rate when in reality it is increasing more quickly than what should be occurring at a natural rate. 
         <br><br>
My primary response to watching this film was anger. I was angry watching that so many people are unwilling to believe evidence that is so clear-disasters as a result of climate change already occurring around the world. Seeing that politicians are so willing to take money from companies that profit from the destruction of our planet in order to receive millions of dollars in donations to further the climate denial cause. To further that, those politicians will use those funds in order to get re-elected and continue to vote against bills that want to create a change and want to limit the impact of climate change. It becomes a cycle of politicians unwilling to stand up against companies such as Exxon or the Koch brothers because they can donate hundreds of millions of dollars to politicians. It then becomes an informal agreement between politicians and companies that politicians will outright deny that climate change is real and vote against any type of reform bills that seek to create change and companies will continue to make donations in order to get them re-elected. It just shocks me to see how quickly people are willing to sell their morals for money and power. 
         <br><br>
With organizations that are created and backed by companies that profit off of climate change, it should come as very little shock that politicians were quick to change their stances on climate change. When President Obama came into office, there was a general consensus among Congress that climate change was real, however, when more wanted to be done than just a simple acknowledgement, many politicians were quick to say that they were unsure if it actually was, and those that did speak quickly lost support from their party and their donors.

  This film really does a good job in allowing viewers to understand how the “skeptics” rise up against the mainstream of human activities contributing tremendously to the climate change on political purpose. One thing that really bothers me after watching the film is why those politicians and meteorologists would rather sacrifice our planet and future generations than acknowledge that we human beings are indeed causing the climate change to a huge extent. Just because of money? Don’t they understand that money would be pointless if our human race could possibly extinct in the near future because of what we do today? Are they really such shortsighted people? If not, then what are the other motivations that drive them to make such decisions? In the meantime, I wonder why the consensus that 97 percent of scientists that have reached cannot outweigh the skepticism made up by the rest. The only reason I can think of is that people are unwilling to live a little bit harder today to reduce the risk that they may end up suffering or even vanishing in the next 30 or 50 years. They dare not to confront the truth. People are brainwashed by the politicians so that they can’t realize the edge of extinction right in front of us. They are immersed in the illusion that the earth itself can handle the problem and we can just continue to live our lives as before. What can we do to wake these people up?

  The main “scientific” argument presented by climate change deniers in the film “A Climate of Doubt” was the idea that “carbon dioxide is plant food.” This reasoning was mentioned in at least three different occasions throughout the film. How do people not see this major flaw? Is this not knowledge people acquire in secondary if not primary education?  You definitely do not need postsecondary education to notice the discrepancy in this argument. I am so frustrated and in awe that all I could do is laugh uneasily while watching these parts of the film. Not because I think it is a joke, but because I could not fathom the “success” of the climate change denial movement.



  
</p><hr>


<p>
  
  I was unsettled by hearing the interviewed people saying that the climate needs no help. Followed up by saying that the climate will warm and cool on it’s own no matter what we do so we just have to wait. It’s a pain to know that people think that climate change isn’t real simply because the planet isn’t as warm as they think it would be. Must the whole planet be on fire for them to actually even care? There is not certain temperature that classifies the immense increase in heat as climate change so why are people acting as though there is? They’ll deny it until it gets too hot for them but by that time it’s too late. 
         <br><br>

Something I learned from this was that the economic downfall around 2008 and the cap and trade on CO2 emissions was a way for climate change deniers to take their attack. Seeing all of the protests and banners ads saying that the cap and trade is killing jobs, increasing taxes, and taking away their freedom. I can see why some people could think this considering they don’t fully understand how a cap and trade program works. But alas thousands of people believed that they could lose their job and have even less money than now. This wealth inequality also plays a big portion into beliefs. If people believe that they are gonna lose their job because of something then they are going to look out for themselves and their financial needs, not the needs of the planet in this case with the cap and trade. Do I blame these people for thinking this way? I don’t think I have the right to because they have been tricked by these CTTs. I am certainly upset though. But these CTTs have been running this campaign of misinformations for literally decades so the blame is to place on CTTs. We must take control and educate everyone, and especially children, about climate change and especially about how climate change deniers have been running this scam in order to prevent people from being tricked. I feel as though a lot of people are easily tricked because they don’t know what the red flags are, so I feel as though investing in educating people on that would be extremely beneficial.

  "A Climate of doubt"
         <br><br>
At first, I am confused about the title of video, what can be the doubt about climate? By watching several minutes of the video, I found that the doubt about climate was ridiculous and logical. I really wondered how they could disagree the fact that the global warming is continuing nowadays and mostly caused by human beings so easily, even with 97% of scientists agreed and numerous data supported, they still thought it was kind of political hoax that tried to fool the citizens. The people that really wanted to lie to citizens were the politicians, those presses and so-called non profit organization. They got the money and power from those big companies. In order to earn more money, the company holders could do anything for that. Because clearly, protecting the envirnoment obviously would block their way to the fortune.
         <br><br>
 
And for sure, I felt pessimistic about American’s future. America has already quitted The Paris Agreement in 2017, which made the America more dangerous because the president Donald Trump held the same position with the “rebellious” people in the video. If those data and evidence showed in the video were not convincing for opposing people, I really did not know what idea could make them agree with excepts the global warming was fake.

I was also alarmed and questioned myself “how could people think climate change is fake?” It’s a dangerous idea that could spread at a surprising rate. People are believing what they want to hear, wha more convenient for them. People favor a politician who isn’t going to implement taxes and industries will give money to the candidates that are willing to lie about the severity of the climate crisis. It’s sick honestly. It’s giving people a kind of twisted hope that nothing is happening and letting them live as if the future is set and safe. The only thing worse about believing the kind of information and data that fossil fuel industries make sure to spread is that the information will be passed down to future generations and they will grow up spreading skepticism about the issue too. It makes me uncomfortable to know what money can do and how politicians are willing to throw aside what maybe once was their goal, which was to do the best for the people. Politicians get corrupted so often in our country that we look at it as the norm and are surprised when we see a honest politician, it becomes something that’s too good to be true and that’s just sad. I hope that our generation does better at informing one another so that we don’t make things worse for the future generations like the boomers did for us

  As with any other political issue, the documentary “Climate of Doubt” emphasizes the divisive issue of Climate Change. However, the problem with this issue is that Climate change has more than just an economic impact on our lives. It cannot be another one of these “hotly debated issues” that government officials argue about for decades because there may not be enough time to do so. Climate change represents more than just a threat to our economy it represents a threat to our way of life.
         <br><br>

Like any other political issue, Climate Change has believers and advocates on both sides of the issue. Those who believe with full conviction that climate change is not real and those that believe that climate change is real. A major problem with this specific issue is the motivation of money and economic gain for climate change deniers. The documentary emphasizes this by showing Exxon and other oil companies supporting campaigns to confuse the American public. 
         <br><br>
Like Ken notes in this video, many of the wealthiest oil companies on the planet would suffer greatly if they were forced to limit their extraction of natural resources. They seem to care more about the financial future of their company than the wellbeing of their planet.
         <br><br>

Like the campaigns to combat “Cap and Trade” many climate change deniers were motivated to do because of the threat that it poses to their own wallets. When the economy suffered in 2008, so did the argument to fight climate change. I feel that this is more than enough evidence to show that many climate change deniers are less concerned about the planet and more concerned about their way of life. 
         <br><br>

However, this argument applies to more than just the average American. The documentary also notes how many politicians have changed their stance on Climate change from 2008 to 2012. The issue has become increasingly controversial and to protect their own positions of power, politicians have chosen to omit their positions on climate change. They would rather stay in power than stay true to their own beliefs.

I completely agree with you! It's very frustrating listening to skeptics try to deny the obvious: climate change in large due to the burning of fossil fuels. There is an insane amount of cold hard evidence that clearly shows a trend of climate change throughout the years, but these skeptics tend to twist, manipulate, and essentially deny it all because of greed. The 3% of skeptic scientists vs the 97% of scientists who believe in climate change in itself already raises a red flag. As mentioned at the beginning of the documentary, "If you pay scientists enough money, they'll find what you want them to find." It's very disappointing knowing some scientists are presenting corrupted data that is essentially convincing many people, all because of money.

<br><hr>
As upsetting as it may be to see scientists like Fred Singer and companies like Exxon contributing to misinforming the public about climate change, their tactics of exaggerating scientific uncertainties, taking over media outlets, and steering the focus towards economy instead of scientific evidence is clearly effective as the documentary "Climate of Doubt" portrays. Small, but powerful groups like the Heartland Institute and the Americans for Prosperity are able to sow doubt and change public opinion in a way that climate change advocates and scientists cannot. More than the climate change denial campaign itself, I am more concerned about how much more effective it is compared to how climate change activists are approaching this "debate." While I am hopeful that the American public is capable and willing to do their own research and educate themselves of the overwhelming scientific evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change and its effects, watching this documentary makes me wonder if communicating the scientific consensus is a priority for politicans and scientists and what more could be done to  positively affect public opinon on the climate crisis.

  “Merchants of Doubt” shows me what are those big industries, like fossil fuel industry, thinking about. They don’t want to have the balance between the environment and the economic profit. Instead, they want to make the maximum profit and are unhappy to lose any penny in their pocket. If we cannot become the hero who save the planet and make a huge contribution to the human history, we need to be the one who does not harm the planet and stop making far-fetched arguments for our selfish desire.

I agree that big industries that specialize in things such as fossil fuels “don’t want to have the balance between the environment and the economic profit,” but I don’t think it’s only these big industries to blame for this ideology. I think that a lot of Americans have this same mind set. Although many Americans might preach, “save the turtles,” and whatnot, they aren’t as truly committed as they might come off as. I think when push comes to shove the average American would also choose economics over the environment whether they realize impacts or not. As humans it feels as if we are naturally selfish because we are always in this survival mode or what’s next mode and a good way to stay afloat and survive is by having enough money to do so. I don’t think most people exactly comprehend how much is enough for their needs and always seek more and more. It’s because of this money hungry mindset that will most likely have even the average American chose economics over the environment.
<br><hr>
I really don't understand why they care so much about losing half of there profits. I agree, they have so much money which really makes me frustrated. What are you going to do with all the money anyways. We shouldn't care about money. We should care more about this earth because there are people around the world being affected by climate change. Also, if we end up in a horrible climate crisis in the future, the money would just be useless and worthless.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with you. The mindset of "save the turtles" has become especially popular over the past couple years. However, Americans do little to actually help promote this belief except for instill little changes into their daily lifestyle such as use metal straws- which has gradually become something of a bit of a trend instead of an actual movement. It is true that we are all inherently selfish and if we do not see the bad effects, then how bad could they possibly be? It amazed me how great of lengths such prestigious titles of firefighters and people in court went to earn extra money for their own benefit instead of state the truth of just how badly the climate crisis is and how big of a trouble we are in. If we do not change this mindset, then we truly will be in a great crisis that we will no longer be able to overcome in the future.

  "A Climate of Doubt" was a very interesting documentary to watch as it showed how the issue of  change has shifted from a human one to a political one. It's funny because up until 2009, I lived in a very Republican community, but I was always taught about the effects of climate change, and how humans should be more aware of the utilities they use, and it was literally right after that that people's point-of-views began to change due to the introduction of climate change into politics. It's very interesting how often people will form their own opinions simply based on the political party they are affiliated with, rather than doing their own research.
<br><hr>

One of the most interesting parts was when they started talking about manipulation of data. For example, how you can choose beginning and end points to favor your argument when it comes to showing the rise of earth's temperature. A ten year period may show the average temperature decreasing but if you look at the bigger picture and at longer periods of time, you can see that it has, in fact, risen. Another thing was the Oregon Petition, signed by 31,000 engineers and scientists. It sounded credible, however, doing a little bit of research showed that all you needed to sign the petition was a Bachelor's of Science degree. You did not have to be affiliated with climate science in any way. Moreover, many people who signed were "celebrities and friends". As Hockenberry described it, "authentic looking documents that don't stand up to independent scrutiny".
<br><hr>

I was also surprised to see that Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi had filmed an advertisement in which they both agreed climate change was real. It was interesting to see that since it has become a partisan issue with lots of money involved from big companies, politicians running in Republican communities will no longer speak up about climate change in fear of losing big donors and votes. This is a big reason for why we all need to vote, and why we need to get money out of politics.



  
</p><hr>


<p>
  
  While watching the documentary I seemed to get pretty worked up by the fact that this group of climate change deniers was getting bigger. The man who was interviewing people, John Hockenberry, seemed to share much of this frustration towards the answers they would give. He would stump them, and they would talk their way out of it by saying things like “nobody knows if global warming is real” or something along the lines of “if scientists wanted to make the people side with them, they should be doing a much better job”. 

<br><hr>

Another thing that really triggered me was the fact that they know that the only thing they are going to be able to do when they finally see that they are wrong, is apologize, because it will be too late. Also, the smugness on the climate deniers faces when they spoke about the “wins” they obtained. For example, when Bob Inglis lost his election because he simply stated that he believed in human causation on climate change, causing people in office to not speak out about climate change anymore in fear of losing power. One thing really stood out was Inglis’ analogy at his last congress conference, where he compared the 98% of scientists agreeing global warming was real vs. 2% who don’t to a child being sick and having the option to choose the treatment that 98 doctors recommend over the one 2 doctors recommend. At that point I thought the climate deniers would come to the realization that they are being irrational, but that wasn’t the case.

  I have already seen both films "A Climate of Doubt" and "Merchants of Doubt", but I decided to write on a climate of doubt as it is more direct about climate change. This film was effective at communicating its main point of climate change being a political issue and an issue in many aspects besides just environmental. This documentary showed people who denied climate change and the purpose of them denying it, but it also included scientists to back climate change. The reaction I had from this film was disappointment more than anything else because I want people to be more concerned about the planet, and seeing how they are exploiting the planet for personal gain really upset me and disappointed me. I learned that most people do actually believe in climate change, they just don’t reveal that they believe in it because they want to gain something, such as money, out of saying it does not occur. This film was quite interesting to watch because it enlightened me on politics dealing with climate change and the environment. Before this film I knew that such things were occurring, but I did not know it was occurring at such a large scale. A statistic that surprised me was that 97% of scientists have backed global warming. This film really showed how politicians use people for personal gain and it bothers me.

  “A Climate of Doubt” is a well-done documentary and I’m glad we watched it for this class. I was 12 when cap and trade was big in America, and in my ignorance, I never really understood the significance or why people were upset if it was good for the earth. Cap and trade is not necessarily a “new” phenomenon, it’s been around since 1992, when U.N. leaders signed a pact to try to implement it. Studying economics now, I find cap and trade to be very interesting; it’s a classic idea that the government can sell a number of permits for pollutants, and the market would trade them amongst each other to high bidders. Many economists project that cap and trade is less costly than a carbon tax for businesses, so it was meant almost as an in between. In theory it would limit pollution greatly, but public backlash was huge because it would definitely cost jobs in the short run. 
<br><hr>

I liked the documentary because it didn’t discriminate or immediately demonize climate change deniers, but it made evident over time how empty the claims they made are. It was almost painful to see Fred Singer’s “the earth is actually cooling” graph get torn to shreds by real scientists. I agree with what Ken said about it not being about proving the earth wasn’t warming, it was about instilling doubt. Americans are busy people, if enough voices start saying something with authority, people are bound to jump on board, especially when deniers say that American jobs are going to be lost, and our economy will take a downturn. People will not do their own research, and that’s why it’s so important to take the time out of our days to go to people who love and trust us and tell them how we feel about the climate crisis.

I think your comment really hit the point of "A Climate of Doubt". In saying that the point of the documentary was about instilling doubt to confuse Americans, rather than completely disprove the science behind climate change, was accurate. This method is also effectively employed by the climate change deniers. If enough voices produce doubt in one thing, others will follow and continue down the same route. You are completely right in saying that most of the public do not do their own research on things that they overhear or see, and are blindly ignorant to news around them.
<br><br>
I also agree in your illustration about the cap and trade policy, where businesses would attack it for costing jobs in the short run. However, a carbon tax would cause even more of a backlash from businesses, which is why the cap and trade bill was able to narrowly pass Congress. I think, no matter what policy is put out, businesses and fossil fuel companies will attack it. They only consider their own profit instead of the well being of the world.
<br><hr>
I did not know much about Cap and Trade so thank you for sharing some of your knowledge. For Cap and Trade, I could see why many were against it. As they mentioned,  it implemented high taxes and job insecurities. I also think, because it implemented these negative effects, the contrarians were able to use this as a boost for supporters. Americans worry much more about the economy and the issues that come about with it dropping.
<br><br>
I agree that the claims the deniers were making were empty. Like you mentioned,  the purpose of the deniers was to mainly instill doubt. Yes, people also due tend to band-wagon with someone of high authority. It is quite upsetting to see that many deniers are those of high status.

  Nowadays, the public does not fully understand the condition of the earth. Such status gives some groups the opportunity to influence social opinion. Like magicians, the powerful companies deceive people's eyes and make them believe rumors. This started with the tobacco industries in the last century. The internal stuff knew all the dangers of smoking, but they blocked the message from the public. But when facts began to spread among the society, they came up with new counterback: they casted doubts. Such method is so smart that later many groups also employ it. Now the tobacco issue becomes the climate issue. Just as Ken mentioned, one of the best solution is to use less resources from the earth, such as the fossil fuels. However, these resources have great economic value, so large companies do not want to loss the opportunity to earn money. When scientists call for actions to slower global warming, they even state that the earth is cooling. I am really sad to see that they buy scientists and doctors in order to spread their lies more effectively. Our governments should formulate regulations although it is really hard for them to do so because they are usually connected with large interest groups. As common citizens, we need to distinguish what is the truth.

 “A Climate of Doubt” is certainly not the only documentary that provides the audiences with the opposition of climate change, but it is one of the most interesting I have seen. The opposition groups such as “Heartland” and “Americans for Prosperity” are quite influential groups that has a handful of powerful political and economic members supporting their back, and I believe it is one of the most important reasons that they were able to impact the political scheme in the American society. It is also scary how large corporations such as ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and the anonymous Donors Trust are able to purchase the opinion of political leaders to go against climate change solely for their profit gains. Throughout the documentary, the “scientists” who provided “data” supporting a decline in global temperature was also very unconvincing, anyone who has basic access to internet could do some research and debunk their proof of “decline”. Since I am an international student from China, I have certainly experienced the negative consequences of climate change, and it is surprising to me how so many people, including the young girl at the beginning of the video, is convinced that global warming is fake, I hope that more people could be opened to both sides of an argument and make their own decisive judgements regarding the issue of climate change.

  I felt frustrated seeing how smug these people were about denying climate change. It also gives us the answer to a question, ‘If we know about climate change, why is nothing being done?’ We know it is real but now the fossil fuel companies who would be hurt by climate change awareness continue planting doubt in society. The campaign these companies launched to stop government intervention has had an immense impact on the climate change movement and increased the number of skeptics/deniers. It was interesting to see the angle they chose for the campaign where they went for things “Americans value”. Their ads and campaigns kept claiming this climate change issue would take jobs away, take their freedom and increase taxes. I feel like if you make that claim about any issue most Americans would become enraged and turn away from it. 
<br><br>

It is sad to see how people would do anything for money because these fossil fuel industries would do anything to discredit the science behind climate change and even fund the climate skeptics. These companies know how much their industries are harming the planet but choose to turn a blind eye because they profit too much to stop it. I have watched the Merchants of Doubt for another class and they act in the same way with human lives. They knew how addictive tobacco was and how it was poisoning the public but still kept denying any health concerns it may cause and pushing the product. Years later, people began realizing how harmful smoking tobacco is for your health and tried making a change. I feel like that is what will happen with climate change, those industries are doing everything to deny how inhabitable our earth will be because of their actions but in decades when we feel the full effects, we will try to make those lifestyle changes but it will be too late. It might already be too late and it's frustrating to see how they target the public to spread their lies. This needs to stop being addressed as a “political issue” because these climate change disasters will affect everyone no matter what “party” they are from.

 After watching this film “Climate of Doubt”, it absolutely overturned my view of life and values. The words said by these “specialists” are a kind of joke! I clearly know that people are just a type of selfish person, which means that we will try our best to maximize the profit that we can get. However, I disagree with what these groups of specialists are doing. They are trying their best to confuse the public. I cannot imagine how selfish these people and some companies are. Due to the fact that there are more and more countries and people focus on climate change, more and more laws about preventing the use of high pollution fuel are being enacted. These laws affect the profit and benefit of these fossil fuel cooperation directly and fundamentally. They want to let people believe that climate change is not caused by human beings, and is not caused by the use of their products. Although they know the truth, just like a person who agrees with climate change when he was in the climate crisis group but totally changed his opinion to the contradict aspect when he became a chairman of the company. How ridiculous this thing is. If they persuade people successfully, what will people do? People will begin to use these products again and produce more and more pollution in the world, which will cause the issue of climate change and global warming to become worse and worse. Profit can let one person just speak against their own conscience. 

<br><br>

Because of the influence of this group of people, more and more teenagers who are not old enough to have their own idea, which means that they are easily guided in the wrong direction. Fortunately, there are a huge amount of people in the world who focus on this issue and I believe that people will find the truth in the future.

I completely agree with everything you said! It's hard knowing that many corrupted scientists are presenting false statements and essentially convincing some people of their ridiculous stance simply because of the wealth that comes behind it. These scientists are doing everything out of complete greed which will ultimately come at a high cost. It sometimes feels hopeless knowing the amount of power these big companies hold, but I liked how you ended your comment with "people will find the truth." Very well written!


<br><hr>
you hit it on the nail with this one. There is a lot of misinformation going around, and some corporations have big hand in it (i.e. Big Oil). It really is, like you said, very selfish of them to put profit above everything else. Could this be an underlying flaw of the capitalist system in which we partake in? We have seen throughout history how the motivation for profit has clouded the judgement of many companies, much to the detriment of working-class people and the environment. We have to see through the noise and look at the bigger picture.

  I really found this documentary interesting and the approach it took when talking about climate change. I like how the began the documentary with the annedote about big tobacco back in the 80s and how they used their money and power to downplay the dangers of cigarettes; this same thing is happening still today but with the discussion of climate change. You can see through this whole film scientists still debating the fact that the climate crisis is not real, fossil fuel companies have so much power in the governmental world and can sway political candidates towards their company. By getting the support of people of power in government, they can continue to sell their fossil fuels and make their profits. Once the population decides that they want to accept the fact that climate change is happening, happening fast, and is largely due to the fossil fuel companies, they will lose profit, so they continue to suppress the actual dangers of this crisis; just like big tobacco did in the past. Eventually the public will figure out how corrupt and deadly these big fossil fuel companies are and will do something about it; but until then, they will continue to downplay climate change, pumping more and more fossil fuels into the environment causing even more irreversible damage, while we wait. Fossil Fuel companies are living in the moment, just trying to make the most money as possible. Climate change is not a debate among scientist anymore, but it continues to be a debate in the political world, due to these big companies with money and power. Overall I enjoyed this documentary, it gave another point of view and continues to reinforce my thoughts on how big companies use their power and money to control over government and law makers; to better themselves.

  After watching “Climate of Doubt”, I feel really confused that 97-99 percents of scientists have said that the global warming was caused by human activities. Why do we still have problem in that? Why is there still some percentages of scientist still misunderstanding? In order to develop new technology and industries, people put lots of green house gases into the atmosphere. Compared to the period of time that global warming is not serious, we have had so many industries and factories during that time. As we can see, this is an evidence to show that human activities cause the global warming. We should face the problem directly but not try to find other excuse.

  After watching “A Climate of Doubt”, I feel that it is easier for me to make the connection between this film and the reading assignment for this week, “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change”. In other words, I am starting to understand and see where climate skepticism originated and the sources of the support that climate skepticism had received over the past several years. It was not surprising to me at all when the documentary revealed that the big fossil fuel industries and companies are the main sources of financial support to climate skeptical scientists, researchers, and projects because they want to oppose all kinds of governmental intervention, legislation, and policies restricting and even banning the extraction of fossil fuels and other natural resources for their own profits. It seems pretty obvious to me that the fossil fuel industry is well aware of the anthropogenic damage and destruction on the planet and it is possibly true that they are conscious of the fact that climate change is real and not a hoax as they publicly claimed to be. However, those companies can only see money and financial profits in front of their eyes that they weigh financial profits as more important than our environment and all lives that depend upon it, including us human beings. They choose to risk the health and lives of our environment and the countless species living on the planet such as humans ourselves and many other species with whom we share this beautiful planet, and they are only doing this because of the huge amount of profits they can reap from extracting fossil fuels from the ground and no other purposes. Those fossil fuel companies have completely lost their morality and conscience when they are facing money, and this is beyond sad or unfortunate that this is almost tragic in the history of modern humanity. 
<br><br>


One thing the documentary mentioned that I did not expect is the shift in the politicians’ political agenda in response to climate change in merely four years from 2008 to 2012. Back in 2008, climate change and global warming were the top priorities of the President and Congress that those topics received massive media exposure and public attention. President Obama and Congress even drafted and promoted a policy titled “cap and trade” limiting the amount of carbon emission from industrial activities that specifically aimed at the issue of climate change and the conditions of global warming. In comparison, fast forward four years and climate change no longer seemed to be relevant in the eyes of the politicians and the White House. It was scarcely mentioned during the Presidential campaign and the congressional campaigns; when the topic of climate change was brought up somehow, the politicians mostly brushed it off or simply dismissed the topic with some very ambiguous wording as they knew that discussing this issue would not help them in gaining votes and support for their campaigns. This is a new piece of information for me because I never knew that climate change used to be given so much attention and public exposure that it once was the priority of policymakers and the White House. Climate change seemed to me has always been an issue that is more or less an “optional” issue in the news that it has been mentioned before but it is not one of the primary concerns such as the economy, immigration, education, transportation, and more. 
<br><br>


This strange shift in the public and political attitudes demonstrated the fossil fuel industry’s success in spreading misinformation about the climate crisis and generating popular doubt and skepticism towards climate change that if the public is doubting about the validity of the climate change issue, then it is very unlikely that they will be prompted to take action to address this environmental concern due to this sense of uncertainty. Additionally, many considered climate change as an issue for future generations and they feel very removed and distant from the causes and consequences of climate change, which is a problem that still exists today relating to popular perceptions towards climate change. 
<br><br>


Despite the claims and negative intentions of the climate change deniers and skeptics and the money-oriented fossil fuel companies, climate change is real and it is happening right here right now on our planet no matter if people like it or not. Those climate change deniers and skeptics are solely deceiving themselves by continuously denying the existence and legitimacy of climate change until it is too late and all of the natural disasters as a result of the changing climate are thrusting upon the entire humanity. If we falsely believe in the misinformation promoted by the fossil fuel industry and the so-called qualified scientists that they are funding, then we are making an enormous, foolish mistake that we will most definitely regret in the future and of which we will not even have the opportunity to make up for if we do not act now. The future of this planet and our dear environment is within our own hands and it is our responsibility to take immediate actions now to remedy the climate issue before the consequences of the climate crisis dawn upon us and we start regretting our past decision of inaction. We cannot even blame the scientists for not warning us beforehand because the truth is, they did and they did it many times, the entire society just refuse to listen and take their advice. Therefore, for us and for our future generations and for the sake of the entire humanity, we need to take action right now starting this very moment.

 While this film was frankly quite painful and frustrating to watch, one of the few things I feel I gained from it is finally an understanding of why and how there are people that don’t believe in the climate crisis. Before this film, I hadn’t heard of climate-gate or seen firsthand just how much the deniers believe in their cause. With climate-gate, these anonymously funded organizations, political motivations, and articles/books opposing scientific studies, it suddenly makes sense as to how action has not been taken. I found it particularly interesting (in a horror-movie, can’t-look-away-way) how Obama’s legislation for climate change was originally passed- prompting the deniers to fight back, and win by leveraging state senators and other people who wanted to remain in power to do what the deniers wanted. I also have sympathy for those who feel that both sides should be considered in research- is or is not anthropogenic climate change real. To ask that is reasonable and understandable, but the problem is that when research shows that it is in fact real, the people still do not believe because that research is over-powered by money in opposition. One of the biggest horrors of this film was also at the anti-climate-crisis conference where they videotaped a girl my age promoting denial. The biggest thing the climate crisis has going for it is my generation strongly supporting, but if that changes, I’m not sure that anything could be done.

Watching Climate of Doubt was frustrating to say the least. It was very difficult to listen to the opinions of these scientists and politicians, when there is so much data and research proving them wrong. There were a few quotes and opinions from different people throughout the film that really made me mad. The first was from Fred Singer, the person I was most frustrated with in the film. He claims that the climate doesn’t need any help from humans, and that climate change is a non-issue, a “phantom issue.” I just don’t understand how you can be a scientist and blindly go against the astounding majority of your colleagues. A quote that bothered me was from Cristopher Monckton of the Science and Public Policy Institute. He was arguing that the excess of Carbon Dioxide was actually a good thing, because “Carbon Dioxide is plant food.” He also said that we need to have “the courage to do nothing” to fix this “nonissue.” The ignorance is baffling. John Coleman, the FOUNDER of the Weather Channel, said “Global Warming. It is the hoax. It is the greatest scam in history” in an ad for Americans for Prosperity. I am at a loss for words. The founder of the Weather Channel? Are you kidding me? The disregard that people in power have for the current facts and data available on climate change and its causes and effects is terrifying and concerning for the future.

 One of the things I saw and paid attention at the most from watching this documentary are how that the politician, or groups of people who are the climate denialist especially the republicans are staying skeptic or some of them just simply ignore the issue saying there is no such thing, they don;t know what exactly is causing climate change, and refuse to answer any questions about it. As a person believe in climate changes, I found some of the reasons that those people have given to insist that climate change crisis doesn’t exist and doubt about the science and scientists iskind of not strong enough to make me to believe in their sides. While it seems climate/temperature declines when compared to years before, it overalls is increasing. And how its disbelief in the scientists and overthrow science research and doubt about its credibility is not strong enough to make people completely not to believe human activities didn’t cause global warming at all. It is just not a strong reason to simply say it is a political science, it is simply false and myth. 
<br><br>
On the skeptics’ sides, it is hard to believe they don’t have funding behind or those profits they get on continuing support the use of fossil fuels is what making them to continue to believe global warming doesn’t exist. It is hard to actually take actions to solve the issue and it often leads to some costs, and people don’t want to take any sacrifice, don’t want to pay extra tax and stop their business; but slowly taking a change and try to address the issue is something really needed to be done. The issue should be just something said as slogan, to be used in elections, or congress or simply try to get people to be on one’s side. The fact that the temperature is rising is something real and it is bring threat to the future generation.

  Watching "A Climate of Doubt" was a somewhat odd experience for me.  I felt as if PBS was treating the Climate Deniers as an underdog and was almost rooting for them.  At no point was there some huge discourse or interview of a major scientist to help debunk most of the claims made by the deniers.  Instead, we were getting snippets of interviews and presentations given at conventions.  Though it is apparent that PBS was just giving the 'facts' of how the deniers operate, I still wonder why they included no denial of the deniers in the documentary.  
<br><br>


I also found it upsetting how thoroughly the climate deniers work for the fossil fuel industries.  These people are essentially trading their morals and the future of our species to make it rich in the short term.  The problem is, money talks louder than the scientific method.  The fossil industries are rich now, and they can pay almost unlimited amounts of money to deny the issue and provide counterarguments.  The part of this that upset me the most is that from a purely capitalistic standpoint, these industries are doing exactly what they are supposed to do.  The only way to get them to change would be to create new laws (such as the sulfur filters) and force compliance.  
<br><br>


The issue with this solution is that many Americans think it would be bad for the economy to destroy all these industries and jobs.  And from a certain limited point of view, that is entirely correct.  What these people are missing is that the shift to renewable and clean resources would inevitably create a huge number of jobs, likely more than currently exist for the fossil fuel industries.  Furthermore, most if not all of these new jobs would be better than the old ones such as coal mining.  This is the narrative we need politicians and influencers pushing, but without the money fossil fuel lobbyists have, it is unlikely we will ever have enough.

  The film "Climate of Doubt" was honestly so frustrating. It's annoying to know that the effects of climate change are so visual and yet politicians want to pretend that nothing's happening. It's even worse to see that they truly believe that humans have absolutely nothing to do with the drastic change to our environment. Hearing that people are also going out of their way to discredit scientists is mind boggling because their job is literally to study the climate and unqualified people want to vilify them.The whole "Climategate" scandal was really disheartening because making up scientific discoveries just to support your cause is absolutely wrong and honestly criminal. I also found it interesting to see that with Obama's presidency he really did try to start making a change towards climate change but his opposers slandered the idea. I can only hope that towards the future American people start to realize just how much trouble we really are and that big companies and politicians are only looking out for themselves.

  I watched "Merchants of Doubt."
<br><br>
After watching the film, I better understood why there has been little progress on climate change even though we've known about the problem for so long. It's basically a repeat of the tobacco industry. They give misinformation to spread doubt. Even though tobacco companies knew cigarettes were bad, they lied to people and convinced them that nothing was wrong with it. It took decades for these people to be held accountable for their crimes. In the climate change debate, its hard for scientists to educate the public about climate change when there is so much backlash from fossil fuel industries. They continue to spread lies even though the evidence is clear that climate change exists and the public believes them. They talk about how our freedom and way of life will be threatened if the government sets laws to fight against climate change. I think many people believe these lies so that we don't have to change how we live.

<br><br>
I respect Bob Inglis for standing up for what he believed in. He could've never fought against climate change and be re-elected. However, he had the courage to fight for something that would be very controversial but necessary. He might have lost his re-election but hopefully he inspired others to fight against climate change.

While I agree with you on your respect for Bob Inglis, I think that him losing his re-election has discouraged other politicians from fighting against climate change. We see now that the actions of politicians are moving more towards trying to not lose the next election rather than speaking on what they believe is best for the people. We live in a society that is too polarized to really get anything done. If a politician steps out of line, they could risk losing sponsors and the next election. With politicians worried about their jobs and money more than the safety of our planet, it is difficult to make progress. It is up to the next generation of young politicians to care more about their own beliefs than keeping their jobs.

<br><Hr>
Although I only watched “Climate of Doubt,” Matthew’s comment allows me to identify overlapping concepts in both the films “Climate of Doubt” and “Merchant of Doubt.” As Matthew mentioned, fossil fuel companies spread untruthful propaganda about climate change in order to favor their own interests. For instance, Fred Singer used a method called “going down the up escalator” while presenting global temperature data in order to argue that the earth was actually cooling. This method of presenting data is flawed because it will zone in on a short time frame in order to show specific cooling trends, however it will not look at the gradual warming going on over a longer time frame. By presenting data in this fashion, Singer is misleading the public into thinking global warming is not occuring. 
<br><br>

Similar to what Matthew mentions from “Merchants of Doubt,” the “Climate of Doubt'' also emphasizes why the public is pressured to believe climate change deniers. People are scared that as politicians focus on improving the environment, taxes will be raised and jobs will be lost. For instance, in the public's eyes it may seem like climate change laws will cause fossil fuel companies to hire less people which decreases jobs, and causes gasoline and other resources to be taxed higher, making daily living more expensive. The public would rather pretend climate change is not an issue at all, than to fix it and face the minute issues that come with it. However, these are silly reasons for people to have believed climate change deniers. This is because other jobs have appeared with the rising use of solar and renewable energy. Also a tax isn’t the only way for politicians to work towards an environmentally friendly system.

  In the film “A Climate of Doubt”, some people believe that climate change is a myth and a hoax. Also, they believe global warming consensus was not based on science. They argued that climate change is a good thing. What surprised me the most is that some scientists found the trend in every ten years is decreasing. Thus, they concluded that the temperature is cooling. However, if we take the change in temperature as a whole, the temperature is absolutely increasing a lot. Those scientists reject global warming are just making a deliberate misinterpretation out of context.

<br><br>

Besides, it is definitely true that implementing carbon tax will bring people many inconvenience, because people should try to cut down emission of carbon dioxide by decreasing the use of private cars, using less electricity, or saving trees. Many citizens, scientists, and governors oppose climate change due to this reason. However, from my point of view, this method would be effective. In this way, more people will have a warning in their minds during their daily lives and attempt to save money by reduce emission of carbon dioxide at least.

<br><br>

Last but not least, a large amount of antagonistic climate change advocators are not scientists. Even though some of them are scientists, they are not specialized in climatology. As a result, we are supposed to focus more on those scientists who dedicated their whole life to study climate change. Their data about increasing temperature, salinity of sea, raising sea levels are real. We must take an action to protect our planet.

When watching "A Climate of Doubt", one of the most terrifying emotions I felt was a sense that the persuasion tactics used were actually beginning to work. It's truly bizarre how powerful misinformation can be. The ethos of the many scientists that were being interviewed heavily contributes to the rhetoric as well. Seeing so many people that I look up to as being educated, smart, and well-versed in their specific field deny climate change up front was quite scary. Luckily, there are many more scientists that have differing views that help soften this blow. Still though, when the few climate scientists that deny anthropogenic change are all congregated int the same area discussing ideas intelligently, it becomes quite difficult to completely block them out. 
<br><br>

The same goes for the data that the creators of this movie used to make their predictions and state their facts. Because of the sheer amount of data that is available on almost any subject, manipulations are quite easy. My statistics teacher once told me that you could use statistics to prove anything if you just spent long enough looking for the right data. For instance, one of the ways that climate change deniers try to deny the process of global warming is by looking at data in a small time frame. The Earth is usually cooler in the winter than it is in the summer, so if you looked only at temperature data from a 6 month period in the second half of the year, it would appear as if the Earth was actually cooling. This is only one of the many ways that information can be intentionally twisted and manipulated to appear more or less important. 
<br><br>

Another point addressed in this comment is that a large portion of climate change deniers have little to no scientific background. For those that do not fully understand the way that science works, it can be difficult to weed out good science from bad science. This can result in many uneducated people believing the first person that tells them something about science in the climate, as long as that person dresses nicely and uses any sort of sophisticated language. History has shown us that misleading the public is not at all a difficult task, but ti  is incredibly immoral and it can potentially be catastrophic for the fate of the human race

  The film “A Climate of Doubt” reveals the dark side of humanity: twisting the truth and posing alternative facts based on their own interests and benefits. This film foregrounded the main battleground for climate change, which is the conflict between scientific evidence and political advantages. I was absolutely shocked to see that there is even this group of elites who believed that global warming is not accelerating and the issue of climate change is just not a big deal. Of course, as the film points out, these so-called “elite” people are changing the American landscape, both socially and politically. By claiming that carbon dioxide is plant food and that the consequences of global warming might not be completely horrible results, the skeptics blew my mind in their “savvy” methods to preserve their selfish desires. This ultimately reminds me of some current politicians, who would twist the truth into alternative facts to strengthen their argument and to consolidate their power. I felt immediately alarmed when watching this film as the feelings that came to me were exactly the same. The owners of those fossil fuel companies would do everything they can to brainwash people into thinking that climate change is false, and it’s not an alarming issue that people might have thought. I could not imagine if all of us, every single one of us is being this greedy and self-centered, how would the future of our planet look like? It will only take much more effort of those activists and scientists to justify the truth and to empower, encourage, and engage people into effective actions.

As I was watching “A Climate of Doubt,” I was appalled by the selfishness of those who attempt to deny the climate crisis by manipulating facts and confusing the public for their own personal gain. Prior to watching the film, I had already known that despite the evidence proving the rising global temperatures due to human action, people still deny climate change, however I didn’t think about how these climate skeptics justified and defended their position. Something that interested me was how the elite groups of climate skeptics try to deceive the public for monetary gain. I think that it is scary that fossil fuel companies will go to great lengths to trick the public into thinking that the climate crisis is fake and it upsets me that these companies probably know the gruesome reality of climate change yet, they only care about financial profit. I believe that scientific evidence should be trusted and relied on so I find it hard to argue with the fact that around 97% of scientists believe in climate change and that it was caused by human action. If the majority of educated scientists are able to support global warming with evidence, why is the public so vulnerable to the tricks of the climate skeptics? This film demonstrated to the audience how easy it is to confuse the public into inaction and gave us insight into the motives and twisted minds of climate skeptics.

Great reply and I agree, this film definitely shocked me when it showed all the climate deniers. More importantly, this film demonstrates how when just one influential politician or leader begins to deny anthropogenic climate change, his position allows for direct impacts on local environments and his ideas could be passed on the different people and groups. These lobbyists for fossil fuel and petroleum companies hold so much power and unless we convince them to switch to sustainable energy sources, the impacts of burning more fossil fuels will be completely devastating to the entire planet.

<br><hr>
I agree with you, this film shocked me when it showed all of the people who are denying climate change. Not only was it the general public that had many deniers but important people such as politicians. It is crazy to learn about how if one influential person denies the facts and tries to manipulate evidence for their benefit, such as money, many people watching will believe what they are stating and stand with them. Therefore, making a great number of people not want to change for the benefit of the world and continue to deny real facts and evidence. It can even get to the point where these people start to threaten activists who believe in climate change and who want to make a difference. This film definitely demonstrated how easy it is to convince and manipulate people to believe that climate change is a hoax and not a real catastrophic crisis happening globally.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you've said. Watching "A Climate of Doubt" really opened my eyes to the horrifying acts that people will do for their own self gain which could in turn be fatal to the entire human race. America in specific is far too controlled by big businesses. I remember watching a film once on how all news outlets are owned by big corporations, and thus no news is going to be completely non bias. There's very few outlets that are privately owned because corporations can buy anyone out that they want, and why wouldn't they? To own a news outlet or a politician is probably the best thing they can do for business, even though it's harming so many people. America is the land of self interest, and it's gotten to a point where there's almost nothing we can all agree on. Politics have become such a divisive thing in this country, and it's sad that we've let it blind us of crucial issues. The climate crisis should not be a political thing. It's a human race thing. The idea that people would rather be rich than have a livable planet for their grandkids is baffling. I'm left wondering why they don't decide to put their money towards something helpful for the planet. I know that right now it wouldn't be in their best interest financially, but seeing as what we need right now is help for the climate, and that need is only going to get stronger, it seems like a good time to switch gears. If big fossil fuel companies could make themselves sustainable then in the end, they'd be making money for longer, and get back a lot of support that they've probably lost.

<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, it is extremely upsetting to see people twist the truth to fit what they want to believe. I don’t understand how people can see the data we are given by scientists, who specialize on things like this, and think the scientists are making it up or making it seem like a bigger deal than it really is. In the film, “A Climate of Doubt”, they talk about how some people believe that scientists are telling the people what they want to hear instead of telling us the truth. This insinuates that scientists are corrupt and everything they’ve tried to prove about climate change is either a lie or overhyped. According to the film, scientists from thirty different countries say climate change is happening and it is man made. Even with this many scientists agreeing with each other on the topic some people still do not believe them. An example of someone that does not believe in climate change is Fred Singer. In the movie Fred says that the Earth naturally raises and falls in temperature, which shows that he doesn’t believe climate change is a real thing that needs to be taken care of. He also says that the science on global warming is overhyped and that the situation is not as bad as people say it is. One part I found interesting was when they showed the trend of how the temperature has been rising for the past decades with a cooling year every ten years.

  I think that that denying the idea of climate change is more dangerous than trying to prove that climate change isn’t real. The way in which we present information to the public is some crucial considering that fact that it has the ability to change the opinions of thousands of people. I don’t know what people who deny climate change gain from trying to prove to the public that climate change isn’t real. From what I understand is that deniers truly believe that they are invincible and stronger than the earth. Like imagine thinking that you are stronger than the earth?! 
<br><br>
From the graphs that Fred Singer was talking about regarding cooling periods our global surface temperature, yea it shows cooling but from each increment, you can see how after each decade temperatures have increased. I don’t know if skeptics see that or realize that, but they are contradicting their own argument. 
<br><br>
Climate science is political only because we made it this way. Fossil fuel industries only protect their own financial interests instead of the well being of their consumers. “If” climate change is real, apologies and inactions have consequences, so wouldn’t the better option be to take preventative measures in making earth a safer and cleaner place for generations to come. By denying climate change and waiting for an actual sign of climate change, we are neglecting to see the bigger picture.

  While watching "Climate of Doubt", I mainly felt frustrated as the film featured politicians backed by corporations and "institutions" that worked to sow doubt for monetary profit. The thing that stood out to me the most was the repeated interviews of climate-change deniers, where the politician would be asked a simple question, and they would either refuse to answer the question, or they would say something along the lines of "I don't think there's a consensus on climate change", when there virtually is. These answers are so obviously being influenced by money or politics, that it's painful to know that these people and the ones who fund them have the power to prevent necessary action for the health of the planet. This was further proven during the segment about the republican incumbent who answered a question saying that yes, he believed that climate change is anthropogenic, and as a result, his career was massively crippled. In the vast majority of elections, incumbents will almost certainly win, and the fact that he didn't signifies something deeply wrong with how the climate crisis is being treated. If every republican who voices a truthful opinion on climate change is shut down by his own party and replaced, how are we supposed to make progress on the issue? 

<br><br>

Overall, I liked how this film introduced the climate change skeptic side of the argument, and actually took the time to use interviews and take footage of skeptic meetings. Although it doesn't present data that support climate change or the future of the planet, it helps to influence viewers by highlighting the corruption in fossil fuel corporations and their funded politicians. In my opinion, this side of the climate crisis is just as important. The first step to saving the planet is actually getting everyone to be on one side; if we fight within ourselves, how will we fight the climate crisis?

  I had already watched A Climate of Doubt about a year ago, so I decided to watch Merchants of Doubt, which I'm so glad I did! This was one of the most well done documentaries I'd ever watched. I really enjoyed how the creators were so creative as to add a magician throughout this film and especially to begin with. At first, I wondered what a magician could possibly have to do in relation to the climate crisis, but it all made so much sense as I kept on watching. I was shocked to learn about the history of the tobacco company because growing up, it had always been something was known to cause harm, hence the warning labels. However, I had no idea that during the 60's-70's there was actually so much debate going on around the idea as to whether or not tobacco was harmful or not (the applesauce comparison was ridiculous). It made me wonder about the possibility that, if we are lucky enough, the generations to come will be able to look back on the history of the climate crisis and think the same thing: "I can't believe this was ever a debate." I was shocked to learn about the tactics the tobacco company used because the same tactics are so obviously being used within the climate crisis debate. One comparison I really liked was when the one guy said that the climate deniers act as a defense lawyer would: they present the evidence that only benefits their client...Seeing how much science is ignored because of the fact that it has become such a political issue makes me worried because if science is deemed unimportant when trying to prove a fact...I find it hard to image what could ever suffice the claim that the climate crisis is real and that is is here. Now.  Nothing seems to be powerful enough to overcome the corruption of politics.

You made a good point in explaining how the documentary brings influences to the audience. Similarly, I also was amazed by the way they put the magician in the scene. It literally made the film more interesting and related. The point I want to mention in this comment is that politicians are the ones who have the ability of leadership. They are the one who make decisions for the country and to make countries connect with each other. Therefore, if we consider global warming a political issue, it will definitely become a debating problem in which people will start being convinced by the experts. The result will be terrible. Although the evidence the scientists prove might not be totally correct, scientists cannot just reject the issue for their own favor since they are the one who actually see the truth and encounter the statistics. The above statements are extremely important for people, especially the experts who are actually doing the research and bringing up facts of global warming, to understand and to put forth towards each other.

  In a previous comment, I conveyed my disgust with the fossil fuel industry and their spreading of disinformation regarding climate change. After watching “A Climate of Doubt,” I have only doubled down and had my feelings reinforced. I don’t want to repeat myself too much, so I’ll just say that it is repulsive that so many people can put their own interests ahead of the preservation of life on Earth as we know it. There are some climate change skeptics who simply have not been exposed to the scientific facts, or have not heard enough to form a solid opinion on the issue. In my view, people who fall under that category can be excused for their skepticism, and it’s up to the rest of us - climate change activists, scientists, and overall the general populace to properly inform them of the looming catastrophe that anthropogenic climate change poses. However, people or organizations such as The Heartland Institute, fossil fuel industry executives, or politicians in the pocket of these industries and corporations absolutely must be held accountable for their actions, because those actions are directly adding fuel to the fire that is the climate catastrophe. 

<br><br>

I firmly believe that in the foreseeable future, such as the next few decades to come, these people who have shamelessly propagated disinformation regarding climate change will be scrutinized and vilified for their actions - and rightfully so, in my opinion. During one of the lectures, a student went up to the microphone and said that climate change is not a political issue, and I wholeheartedly agree. It’s a powerful force that does not discriminate on whether you are poor or rich, it does not care about your skin color, whether you are liberal or conservative. The shifting climate will lead to unpredictable weather events in the short-term, and devastating long term effects that have been predicted by scientists - effects that we are already beginning to feel around the world: sea level rise, ocean acidification, desertification of once-green lands full of life, and overwhelming migrations of climate refugees. These catastrophic effects are going to end up costing human lives, and fundamentally change the face of the planet, for the worse. If drastic global action is not taken to combat climate change this very decade, all of these horrible events will undoubtedly occur, and I think that whatever survives of the human race will look back upon these current times that we live in, and lament how we could’ve saved ourselves but didn’t.

  In "Merchants of Doubt" the most shocking part of the film was hearing how companies hire the same "independent" speakers. There are several politicians who appear to be separated from companies that speak their voice. However, behind the scenes these people are being paid to speak up on the news or through other forms of media. Companies such as Exxon Mobil hire these individuals to discredit the scientific work being done on climate change. The questioning of climate change research confuses the public and allows distrust in scientists to arise. Not only was I shocked to hear that companies hire politicians, but that multiple companies hire the same people. This interconnects several different problematic companies such as oil and tobacco. The same people who speak out against research that proves cigarettes are dangerous are the same people who claim anthropogenic climate change is a hoax. Not only is it sickening that these companies go to great extents to question science, but it's also frightening how much power they have. Big businesses are able to persuade a large group of people into following their agenda, which makes me question how far will they go just to continue to make money.

Overall, I believe that the film "A Climate of Doubt" does a great job in telling the origin story of climate change denial, including it's use as a political tactic. In the telling of this story however, I believe that the film really just reveals many of the climate deniers it featured as the frauds and sell-outs that they truly are.

<br><br>

For example,  when the journalist in the film asks North Carolina State Representative Bill Cook about what he relies on for evidence of his doubts about climate change, he states "I rely on whatever science makes good sense." This statement by Cook is absurd, and goes against the objectivity of science. You can't just choose what science to believe in based on your existing ideologies! By saying this I believe that Cook just shows himself to be spineless and uninformed on the topic. In addition, one of the chief climate deniers featured in the film, Myron Ebell, states that his side has already won the climate debate with those who "have a closer relationship to tangible reality." By saying this, Ebell basically just shows that his argument has no substance, and reveals himself to be someone playing to the egos of those who already support him. Ebell clearly just wants to pump up his side, and seems to care little about what his statements actually mean.
<br><br>


In both of these statements, I believe that Cook and Ebell come off as manipulative liars who know little about the actual science behind climate change and will do or say anything to get a vote or a few dollars. Unfortunately, comments like these were repeated far too many times in the film,  and it is honestly sad to see that so many people listen to what these guys have to say.

I agree with you! The climate deniers only want to believe what is convenient for their lifestyles. Every time the interviewer would ask about their stances on climate change, there was not a single answer that satisfied or merely answered the question. I kept looking for some sort of defining evidence that made me see how they could think the way they do but all I found was incomplete science (e.g. the "cooling" trend). Their denial is heavily based on opinion, not fact and yet they think they are capable of debunking straightforward evidence. They take parts of science that are relevant to their argument. It's almost like cutting letters out of a magazine article or title to create your own words and phrases. 

<br><br>

I have realized all of these deniers sound the same, with the same perspectives, with the same power, and with the same arguments that make no "good" sense at all. They only make "good sense" to Cook because it is good for him and the rest of his years. I am glad I have got the chance to hear what they actually have to say. Am I moved by their words though? No. But I am disappointed that some people are.

<br><hr>
I also found myself questioning the statements made by the key figures of the climate denial movement shown in the film ’Climate of Doubt’. Aside from these statements being obviously made with the intent to misinform and poorly represent good, conclusive data, which becomes clear upon even shallow investigation, the ways in which the folks behaved while making these statements was also of concern; the interview with Bill Cook was probably the best example of lack of questioning in terms of the information that he was fed by these conservative, free-market prioritizing groups. 
<br><br>


I found the interview with the president of Americans for Prosperity, Tim Phillips, to be particularly interesting. He, I assume under the desire to seem like the AFP is an ‘open-book’, provided direct answers to the questions posed about the organization and their funding. When asked about Exxon’s involvement in their funding, he gave laugh and talked for a few seconds about their ‘lack of corporate funding’; when asked about his involvement with the Koch brothers, the smile that had been there when answering the previous question went away, leaving us with his direct answers yet again. 
<br><br>


This response, on the surface appearing genuine, was indicative of something being somewhat off. This was just a feelingI had, but it wasn’t right. The film then goes on to detail the involvement of Donors Trust, which essentially serves as a filter of anonymity for these corporations to dump money into projects that they support, but in a way that doesn’t garner public hatred for the companies themselves. They can still serve their own interests yet no longer can receive any of the criticisms for it that had come before.

  "A Climate of Doubt" feels like the film with the least content of all the films so far. It mostly reiterates the fact that yes, there are climate deniers, yes, they are paid by big businesses, and yes, they want to make the public unsure of the climate crisis. Showing off different climate deniers doesn't expand on that much. Still, this was an important film to watch. If you want to make a change, you need to understand your opposition. This opposition is scary. They look facts straight in the face and decide not to see them. It's a prime example of cognitive dissonance.
<br><br>


I know that the heads of this movement probably don't believe the things they're saying, they just want money, but they are fooling those who don't know better. They are actively trying to make the world a worse place. I don't understand how anyone can justify that morally. This, in particular, is what baffles me the most about the climate crisis. How can some people have the power to change the world for better, and decide that for worse is a better option?
<br><br>


I would enjoy this film more and find it more helpful if it gave examples of how to change denier's beliefs. Just knowing that there are people who don't believe in science is not useful to me. How can I change that?

I do understand what you said, the movie seems kind of repetitive and talks a lot about how different deniers have their views in that way and why they do that. The main concept we mainly get out from this movie is that those deniers are usually politicians or profit maker from the use of fossil fuels would disagree with climate change no matter what. Either they completely do not believe in climate change at all or maybe they do in fact know that climate change exists but they refuse to admit there is a climate crisis but it would affect their opportunity to make money and this is why they don’t want to answer any questions regarding the issue. No matter it is watching a movie like this or reading some article like this, I know your feeling of how such people who have strong power in this place, country and community don’t want to make any changes to help save the place we are living but instead are making them even worse. They think profit making is more important than the sustainability of the earth but my question is, what is the point of having and making more money when we are losing a safe and healthy place to be able to live? People who give all types of excuses and arguments to support their positions are some time making me feel ridiculous and frustrated because I can’t believe how they can still defend their arguments when their arguments are that weak and hard for people to believe at.

  “If it is not a scientific debate … then what type of debate is it?” 
 <br><br>

Political. Political. Political. The film “Merchants of Doubt” reveals how when scientific discoveries are made that interfere with large capitalist industries motives, then suddenly it is not a conversation of health, safety, facts or even research studies but moreover is transformed into a debate of power surrounding wealth to manipulate the facts. The big example discussed throughout the film is the Tobacco industry, which had a clear understanding of the harm caused by the chemicals active in cigarettes, but pleaded ignorance in order to keep the revenue from their billion dollar industry. These industries are thriving off the harm caused to the innocent consumers manipulated by these political agendas simply because it has been made evident that they place monetary wealth over human life. This trend is shown throughout multiple industries: the chemical industry, the meat industry, the coal industry, the oil industry and even more. However on the topic of the climate crisis, the ignorance has reached a whole new level as it has been decades, and studies after studies that are being manipulated to the public so that they won’t be concerned about the true dangers of the future of planet Earth.
 <br><br>

One thing that really angered me was the segment with Marc Moreono. The fact he acknowledges that there is no question to the validity of climate scientists research yet continues to harass and encourage violence on scientists who are simply trying to better the world through their studies, really puts me at unease. This is blatantly one of the issues with turning scientific research into a political debate, similar to religion, science should be independent of politics. Yet, this is wishful thinking, especially in today’s political climate as religion is now being intertwined with conservative policies so what is stopping the far right from making everything political. This is one of the main concerns I had with the movie, seeing as under Donald Trump’s administration there is no way to take a step back and view scientific studies objectively. Furthermore, this film just left me frustrated because there are so many alternatives that have been invented to prevent the climate crisis from progressing that have been ignored due to political interference.

Your response is spot on. Reviewing the aspects of climate denial arguments, it seems that they all trace back to fossil fuel money. Their foundation for justification is based on money, not scientific evidence. They value perception over logic and strive to blind the public from the true horrors of climate change. The film, Climate of Doubt, presented similar findings to me when it came to the motives of the climate change debate. Environmental activists and alarmists call to raise awareness in hopes that steps towards becoming more sustainable will take place. In my opinion, using our earth’s resources more effectively does not seem like a villainous thing. But that’s exactly how the climate deniers see things, so they take to aggressively dismissing scientific research on the basis of petty critique. The film’s crew follows top climate deniers through their life’s work, and it’s terrifying how deeply they have convinced themselves that climate change is nothing but a hoax. These delusional men have allowed the pursuit of economic growth by large industries to buy their common common sense and replace it with propaganda. When you take a step back, you start to realize that, eventually, every aspect of climate change denial leads back to politics. Just the branding of Climate of Doubt alone reveals much about the public consensus of climate change. Originally, the film was marketed as an objective look into climate change, but years later was presented as a satire. This is a direct reflection of how political persuasion can manipulate the truth. I, too, find it incredibly frustrating how politics can so easily force corruption on the scientific world; actions must be taken to separate the truth before further harm is done.

  A Climate of Doubt and John Hockenberry’s coverage of the issue of climate change doubt is especially informative of the largely political reason for people who doubt climate change. Despite this, the report manages to get both sides of the issue without any obvious or clear bias. Instead, it is able to display the obvious ignorance of conservatives who are too caught up in ideology or policy to pay attention to the planet they are bickering on. 
 <br><br>

 This comment makes it clear that I was not convinced by any of the arguments put up by the conservatives of the documentary. This is due to things like shady donations from “Donors Trust,” the closed-mindedness of the climate doubt experts, and their lack of scientific evidence and backing compared to those who believe in climate change. Also, I was especially disappointed by the before-and-after coverage of Republican candidates on the issue of climate change. Examples like Newt Gingrich sharing a commercial with Nancy Pelosi calling for action on the issue and then calling it a stupid idea a few years later were pretty eye-opening. It seems that opposition to belief in climate change is largely driven by politics and profit rather than actually caring about the well-being of our planet or for its inhabitants.

 Much like the reading from this week, “A Climate of Doubt” was frustrating to watch. There are SO MANY problems surrounding taking action on climate change, and the filmmakers presented them very effectively in the documentary. It really disappointed me how only around twelve years ago, the public truly cared about climate change. Immensely influential people such as President Barack Obama urged the focus of our government and our people to be on the future of our planet. But as the years progressed, organizations such as the Heartland Institute began spurring doubt of its existence, leading to widespread disbelief and denial.
 <br><br>


I was outraged to hear claims such as the following statement by Fred Singer, a retired physicist who spoke at a climate conference presented by the Heartland Institute: “There’s nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It’ll get colder. It’ll get warmer. We just have to wait a little.”
 <br><br>


“Wait a little.” Is that really what he just said?? Wait for our planet to fix the problems we caused??

 <br><br>

Evidently, this isn’t the first ridiculous statement I’ve heard, but hearing that angered me, to say the least. Watching the documentary also made me realize that there’s a big issue with the types of people who put those messages of doubt about climate change out there: They're not scientists. They're lawyers, economists, public policy specialists—people who specialize in getting messages out there, whether true or false. This serves as a reminder that we need to ensure that the people we listen to are actually credible.

 <br><br>

The last part of “A Climate of Doubt” that I want to mention is Bob Inglis, a predominantly conservative politician whose campaign collapsed solely because he agreed on anthropogenic climate change. It really resonated with me when he made the analogy of the consensus of human-caused climate change with a child being sick. He prompted the public with this: “[Y]our child is sick. 98 doctors say ‘Treat him this way.’ Two say ‘No, this other is the way to go.’" He paused, then responded as the world is responding to the 97% of scientists who agree climate change is real and anthropogenic: "I’ll go with the two.”

I whole-heartedly agree with this comment. I found myself in an irritated state throughout the entirety of the film. I continuously rolled my eyes as people being interviewed kept stating how they don't believe the science, but rather these other sources (which are all in fact funded by fossil fuel companies). It is mind boggling how one cannot believe a person who studies this topic for a living, and then trust someone with no experience in the field. However, it is understandable. The politicians and organizations behind anti-climate change movements are aware of the indecisiveness of people. They utilize this for their own personal gain; either through votes or a gaining of money. Political messengers are paid by corporations that are either actual fossil fuel companies, or those that are funded by fossil fuel companies. 
 <br><br>

Along with this, politicians know that people are more likely to stay within their political party. So if one Republican goes against climate change, they all will, thus leaving the public to follow them blindly. It was also disturbing how Republican politicians act when asked about climate change. In the film Fred Upton, a chairman on the Committee of Emissions refused to answer any questions on climate change. In fact, before being a chairman (aka before getting paid by major fossil fuel companies and the like) his views on climate change were different. On his website it even said “climate change is a problem” which was deleted once he became a chairman. If that doesn’t indicate that these people are purely focused on money, I don’t know what will. 
 <br><br>

This brings me back to something I discussed in my comment on the last piece. We need transparency with research on climate change. If anti-climate change companies hide who their funders are, we need to be open. We need to explain the science behind what researchers are doing in colloquial terms, so anyone can understand what is happening. Once we are more open, there will be less uncertainty among the public, and they will have all the knowledge they need to understand that climate change is in fact a dire issue.

I agree with Enya’s points about the laziness of politicians and disheartening comments some of them make, specifically Fred Singer’s. How can one really suggest waiting for things to get better? And how can he make such general statements that make the climate seem like non issue (it will get colder/ warmer). It is people like Singer, the big oil companies, and any other selfish money-seekers that are truly holding us back from making real progress.
 <br><br>

you are also right about the messages being put out. How do you get a story to go viral? You have money or a juicy story that gets people’s attention. How are the Kardashians still so popular and why do I know what Kim did on her last weekend getaway? The media. The same goes for information on climate change, sadly. It’s lawyers and lobbyists and people who bribe or lie that get the most attention and it is up to the people to decide what is true. It is a massive issue that people don’t know what a credible source is and how to differentiate it from something false. Perhaps if there was more widespread education and more emphasis on credible sources about climate change in our elementary schools, junior highs, and universities, we could have a smarter more skeptical population that makes sure a source is credible before believing it. On the other hand, while I do not condone or sympathize with politicians, I do understand the difficult position they are placed in. If they do not please their constituents, they will be removed from office. These politicians have families and people they care about, how are they to provide if they get removed from office and are left without a job? Maybe that is why politicians are so complicit with supporting what their constituents want--regardless of the morals and real facts behind it. In short, they may feel that they don’t have a choice (because they will always choose to provide for their family/ loved ones before considering anything else).

I share your frustration with how the retired physicist says we just have to wait a little for global temperatures to eventually stop rising.  The irony is, the Earth is very capable of recovering from global warming and this extreme pollution as it has done before,  but what it took was mass extinction.  Environmentalists want to preserve the Earth, but this is arguably chiefly to save ourselves since the Earth and new life forms will reemerge, only after Earth's natural defenses have wiped us parasites out that feed on it.   What we are waiting for is our own demise, and we won't be able to survive to witness the development of new life on Earth as it restarts another time.

I think the subject of "A Climate of Doubt" also connects well to the generation divide.  Taking a cynical point of view this time, I think nearly everyone is selfish.  The older generations want what's best for them in that the economy lasts strong for the remaining of their lives, so they support fossil fuel businesses which are also selfish in their capitalist goals.  Their priorities make it much easier for the disinformation campaigns to convince them to be climate change deniers.  Younger generations want what's best for them in that society will remain healthy throughout their lives, which is seriously threatened by climate change.  The disinformation campaign uses arguments and lies that their targets would want to believe.  It makes their targets easy to convince, and all the disinformation campaign has to do is add in some random, unrelated science like how plants like carbon dioxide.
<br><hr>

When you mentioned the frustration you felt watching "A Climate of Doubt," it was easy to understand exactly how you felt. Watching this documentary, I also felt upset with the arguments made. I also felt frustrated by the fact that politicians continued to deny the research presented by scientists. Instead, they chose to support the large, fossil-fuel companies that benefit off the destruction of the planet. Hearing Fred Singer state that climate will change regardless of what humans do made me want to yell in anger, and also made me wonder, as you commented: "Wait for our planet to fix the problems we caused??"
 <br><br>

"Climate of Doubt" did a great job of presenting both the perspectives between skeptics and non-skeptics, but I still cannot justify the reasons for those believing climate change is a hoax.  While I understand that it is all economically-motivated, I still cannot justify their continuation to ignore the statistics of scientists and the consequences slowly presenting itself. Money will continue to be their priority, and in a world driven by exactly that, when and will they ever change?
 <br><br>

The media does a terrible job of providing necessary information to the public and by credible sources. In today's age of social media, anyone has the platform to put their thoughts out there. And while this is a very cool thing, it also means that there is a great chance that misleading information can be the forefront of those looking for it. In the documentary, they did mention that politicians continued to support the ideologies of "lawyers, economists, public policy specialists—people who specialize in getting messages out there, whether true or false." Freedom of Speech is the prevailing principle of America; I have to wonder that while ensuring information is coming from credible sources, will this principle be an issue in facilitating that?
<br><hr>
I definitely share your frustration in watching this film. I also agree with you in that it is important to be well aware of who is promoting climate change denial, as it is often lawyers, politicians, economists, and anything but scientists, who are the only occupation among those mentioned that actually have the knowledge to understand this subject at length. The analogy made at the end of the film also stood out to me, as I think it would be the best way to present the fact that 98% of scientists agree upon the existence of anthropogenic climate change to climate change deniers because it highlights just how stupid climate change denial is because the experts on the matter all agree. 
 <br><br>

Perhaps the primary argument behind climate change denial is that there is no scientific consensus, as mentioned in the film. This myth is grossly inaccurate and misinformed. It's irritating that people even believe this when a simple google search will prove otherwise. Something even more disturbing is the lack of political action on the matter as characterized by Fred Singer. It seems like our world will end before substantial political and economic action is taken against the environmentally hazardous practices that exacerbate climate change. And that thought horrifies me. 
 <br><br>

This film also reminded me of the importance of verifying the sources in which you obtain information from and to always seek different sources because it showed how the way in which news is presented can significantly change public opinion. People used to be more concerned about climate change until various conservative groups started spreading misinformation causing much of the public to change. Whether it be from Twitter, Facebook, NBC, Fox, Vox, etc. the news reported to us is inevitably going to be presented in a biased manner and sometimes they will spread blatant lies and misinformation.
<br><hr>
I resonate with the outrage and disappointment you felt while watching this film. A huge problem in the climate crisis is that a large portion of our country holds more trust in politicians and news organizations than in scientists. It bothers me that people cherry-pick the data proving the existence of climate change, and then present it in such a way to a less educated audience in order to cause climate change denial. Because the majority of the country is not highly educated in a scientific discipline, it’s rather easy for fossil fuel companies to prey on this lack of knowledge. 
 <br><br>

I also liked that you commented on how those that are spreading these messages of denial are those that are well trained in getting messages out there. Someone highly skilled in the use of rhetoric can convince anyone who is not well-versed in a particular subject of anything. Furthermore, the fossil fuel companies know to prey on those that have uncertainties. If you are on the fence about a particular issue, it’s rather easy to be convinced to join a certain side. As I felt with the reading from this week, I find it disgusting that fossil fuel companies will knowingly manipulate people to promote their own greedy interests.

<br><hr>
I thought it was very insightful to talk about how truthfully we are taking an alarmist state about climate change due to the fact that if we don’t--we will become extinct. In reality, the earth can recover from our damage by wiping us out and eventually some years later repopulating with a new generation of life forms. So “earth” is not doomed, our species is. Eventually, our species will become extinct--just as every generation has before us. What we choose to do about climate change now will determine how soon our extinction date comes.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you on how ridiculous we have let this issue become. I feel a deep despair around the fact that fossil fuel companies have continued to spread false information and corrupt government officials with their donations. I think that they are the entire reason that the world is going to shit, because like you said if they hadn't created doubt then we could have begun switching to renewables way earlier. I also agree with you in the fact that people need to know where their information is coming from and what sources they are listening to. It pains me that these deniers are hiring people who call themselves scientists yet are anything but. In one of my Poly Sci classes we learned that when the costs of gaining information are high- in terms of money and time- people are most likely not willing to dedicate the time it takes to correctly edicate themselves. The fossil fuel corporations are taking advantage of this and are constantly raising the amount of time and dedication it takes to find the correct information by muddling the topic with scores of false reports and articles. This causes more and more people to give up on trying to find the correct information, ultimately allowing the fossil fuel companies to continue destroying our planet. I think it should be mandatory for everyone in college universities to see this documentary as well as other scientific climate change related ones as well. It is time for people to learn the truth. It is insane to me that the fate of the entire planet is resting in the hands of a few select people. These few people, those making up the fossil fuel companies and the government officials they support, are betting on humanity's survival all because they become extremely wealthy off of destroying the earth. They are betting wrong, and it will mean death to us all.
<br><hr>
I very much agree with this comment because I found myself outraged at the display of people in power who so openly deny climate change. These people are dangerous because, as the film states, they bring “skeptics to their feet.” Basically, they tell people who are unsure about climate change all the things they want to hear. They tell them that everything is okay and there is no need to worry. Statements such as these are far more attractive than stating how the climate is getting worse, so when people hear powerful figures say it, they are inclined to believe it. This is why the spreading of false information about climate change is so incredibly dangerous. It tricks people into believing that there is no reason to be alarmed, and it makes environmental advocates seem like mere alarmists. Everyone deserves to hear correct information and be educated on the issue as a warning of the consequences we will face as a result of climate change. I feel angered when I see powerful people using their platform to lie to their audience just for the purpose of telling them what they want to hear. This film captured that notion very well and I hope that it helps to clarify why and how so many people are able to deny the existence of climate change.

<br><hr>
I agree with you, watching the film was frustrating to watch. After watching "A climate of doubt", I was really amazed by who has been keeping climate change scientists on their toes when trying to prove to the public the existence of climate change as they are mercilessly discredited by professional public speakers. Fossil fuel companies are paying professional public speakers that know how to rattle up a crowd to project their anti-climate change agenda to their audience. The public speakers are not scientists but are being taken more serious than actual climate change scientists who have degrees on the topic. This comes to show how people blindly follow charismatic leaders, whether the agenda of the charismatic leader is ethical or not. climate change scientists need to learn how to talk to their audience without using scientific jargon to average people who are not scientist--like Rachel Carson. Rachel Carson is someone who did a great job communicating to her target audience about the dangers of pesticides and chemicals by avoiding using scientific jargon to her audience.

<br><hr>
I also struggled to watch and read the both pieces this week. They are both so frustrating to watch as you stated, and it sucks to see the way all these people really manipulate and jeopardize the world this way. Throughout the documentary “Climate of Doubt” I was angry that all these people denying that climate change is an issue are all predominantly white men… 
 <br><br>
These men are not the ones who will be impacted the way POC men, women, children are already being impacted by climate change. Organizations like the Heartland institute are really going out of their way to destroy the lives of others and of the planet. Watching how politicians were/are afraid to even speak on this issue is so upsetting because all of our lives are on the line, and there is no more time for denial. Similar to how you stated, watching the documentary and reading the book state ridiculous claims like “its natural” and that “we live in a CO2 starved world” has me angry.
<br><hr>

I totally agree with what you have said. Looking at these conventions about climate deniers in the documentary “Climate of Doubt” I have no other words than to say how crazy this is. The paranoia to deny the overwhelming scientific evidence as a conspiracy is beyond my understanding. These conventions come off as just an echo chamber where people join together so they can listen to what they want to hear. It makes me wonder what it would take to convince them otherwise, but considering their attitude towards the current evidence makes me believe it might be near impossible, unfortunately. 
 <br><br>

And thank you for bringing up the “Wait a little” comment. Assuming that they are correct, and everything will correct itself with a “little” time, a little time for the planet is a lot of time for us. Yes, the planet has been able to fix itself after past catastrophes but if we wait until then, the damage would have already been done and countless of humans and other living being would have already paid the price by then. It makes no sense to wait when we can do something to reverse our mistakes right now.

<br><hr>

I share your frustrations with watching this film. I too was amazed at how politicians seemed to easily flip their views on such an important issue because of the negative propaganda surrounding the topic of anthropogenic climate change. Having watched the news and followed political discussions on climate change today, I was surprised by how many conservative politicians actually spoke for combating climate change around 2008, and subsequently disappointed as the film then showed them denouncing this positive stance. I was also disappointed by some of the more liberal politicians who I respect (namely Obama) as they too drastically toned down their support and discussion of climate change. It was amazing and sad to watch how successful the climate change denier campaign was in turning the tide from support to measures concerning climate change, to its general taboo in policy, particularly considering the lack of evidence to support the movement.
 <br><br>

 I was also struck by Bob Inglis’s analogy on the sick child in relation to climate change action. I felt like his example made the effects of climate change more personal. Of course one would not follow the advice of two doctors over the advice of 98, the odds are that if 98% of the doctors believe one treatment will be successful, then the sick child will likely respond well to that treatment. It is the same with climate change, why follow the results of 3% of scientists, particularly when their data is skewed and takes only a selective look at temperature patterns over time, when 97% of scientists are able to provide ample evidence that climate change is real.

  After watching “A Climate of Doubt”, it proved my assumptions right about the people who believe that climate change is a myth. The quote, “They think of themselves as rebels up against the biggest players in science, government and the media” says it all. These people don’t care about what they are even saying. Many of them are just trying to cause commotion and be a big voice in society. They get a thrill out of being “rebels” and the worst part about it is that they thrive off any support they can get and it only gets worse from there giving them power rush. These people are like internet trolls who scroll through comments just to pick on people and start arguments. Once they get a response back, they are pleased with the fact that they riled someone up enough to fight. 
 <br><br>

The problem with these people especially is that they do not even have sturdy grounds to stand upon in their argument. At least people who believe the climate crisis is real have a set argument about one thing and one thing only that the climate change is debilitating the earth. The opposing side is more laissez faire as seen where they say, “There's nothing wrong with climate. It will change no matter what we do. It'll get colder. It'll get warmer. We just have to wait a little.” This is basically just throwing it up to the wind and saying whatever happens happens and if we die so what. They don’t even know the true patterns of the climate and with the idea of “waiting a little” they will soon see that there is no time to wait and this needs to be figured out now.

 It is really upset that so many politicians and famed figures deny the existence of climate change. As most people are in agreement about climate change and 97 percent of scientists admit the actuality of global warming, there are still some famed people that ignore the issue or question the scientific facts. As they said, the climate was actually cooling down each decade, but they forget the facts that in general, in the overall analysis of climate, we can find the weather became hotter and hotter based on the data showed in the film. It seems that they just take a small piece of data and deceive the masses. They are so powerful that even young adults are reluctant or trust their beliefs like the girl in the film. I feel angry and frustrated. In my opinion, the first and most important step is persuading all of, or at least most of, people over the world to believe that climate crisis is now very severe and urgent, and it is man-made because of the consumption of fossil fuels and the vast release of carbon dioxide. More evidence and facts are needed and meanwhile, governments should take action to mitigate the problem, and individuals should also make their efforts to protect our planet. I hope as time goes on, politicians could come out solutions and people could work together to mitigate the issue and save our Earth.

Throughout “A Climate of Doubt,” I thought it was interesting to see the key players and circumstances that contributed to support for climate change deniers. At a conference on the “myth” of climate change in Chicago, it seemed as if there was a significant presence of individuals with scientific degrees, which was quite shocking to me. Following the release of the documentary An Inconvenient Truth, a push for climate regulation backed by a consensus in the scientific community on anthropogenic climate change dramatically increased. However, inaction seemed to be a major problem. It was distressing to see that the fear of voicing opinions on climate change among members of Congress was prevalent, despite such a call to action among the executive branch of the country. I was especially struck by the case of Congressman Bob Inglis, a conservative Republican who was ultimately voted out of office for his favoring of legislation to curb carbon dioxide emissions. I think it shows the fragility of a legislator’s position when it comes to significant issues; however, it is also evidence that the climate change has become a political issue, one that ignores the broad scope of the crisis at hand and diverts our attention away from the reality of the urgency of our present situation. As Ken points out in his film introduction, the goal of climate change deniers is not necessarily to convince the public that climate change is not real but to cast doubt on the influence of human activity on the problem, leading to the same end: inaction.

I loved your comment and find it very similar to my own beliefs. It is interesting to see the mind of the climate change deniers and definitely very puzzling when there are people with scientific degrees stating the "myth" of climate change. Inaction has an always be a major problem in regards to climate change. From legislators to the masses, there has been a large effect from inaction. Knowing our legislators are against climate change seems to call upon the hopelessness of the situation. Concerning Bob Inglis, yes that is terrifying but at the same time can the opposite be true. If someone is not curbing carbon dioxide emissions (s)he can also be dismissed. Legislation positives are meant to be fragile because of the power of the people but at the same time what if the people get confused with the climate change deniers. Climate change will always be a political issue and very much neglects the whole issue in and of itself into politics. Inaction is something that we can no longer afford and there will be a time in which no one in the right mind can deny climate change; we can only hope that we will never have to reach that point.

Watching "A Climate of Doubt" was also interesting for me to watch. I agree that the fact that they even have these  "myth" climate change conferences and the fact that there are scientists who attend is very shocking. My main problem with the climate deniers shows on the film is their inaction. A legislature shown on the film basically said that he disregarded the scientific facts and consensus simply because his explanation "just seems more logical". The fact that there are lawmakers out there who think this way is alarming. For example, one man on the film talked about how plant use C02, therefore "its good for the planet". This just shows the level of ignorance held by some deniers. Cognitive dissonance leads these people to change their goal. Instead of convincing that climate change is a hoax(impossible to argue), they instead change their goals to deny human causation. I think this inaction is the biggest threat to the planet.

 After watching the film, I couldn't understand how could they say that human activities have nothing to do with climate change. From my perspective, I don't believe it. No matter climate crisis is a political issue or anything else, I believe there is a climate change happening, and humans must have a contribution to it. The film was published many years ago. These scientists in the movie claim the fluctuation of climate is normal. However, since time had passed, the result is quite obvious. The climate hasn't declined, and the environmental problem is getting worse. Hurricanes,  wildfire, extinction of species... They are all happening around the world right now. No matter what they said, I still believe the exsist of climate change, and I believe humans have made this and humans should change it.

 After watching the movie A Climate of Doubt, I feel bad for the facts that those scientists who warn the public about climate crisis were attacked by the public. I do not really believe that the climate skeptics are the real deniers who are ignorant about how the world is right now. From my point of view, probably half of them actually know what is happening right now. They know that the scientists are right, the climate is changing, and human activity is destroying the planet. One possible evidence for this is that skeptics never throw out a single proof for the idea that “climate change is not due to human activity, and it’s virtually beneficial for the world.” Another movie, Merchants of Doubt, has pointed out that fact that skeptics are not the real skeptics. They just like money more than the environment.

  It frustrates me that climate change is even a political topic. it should not be divided by parties, scientific fact should be something both parties can agree on. The future of our earth and humanity is not a political issue. I also happened to notice that almost every single person that appears in this video, both in the background and being interviewed, is a 45+ year old white person. The majority are white men. Interestingly this demographic of people is the same demographic that has caused most of climate change. One man even said that "what [they're] fighting is the expansion of government" which just goes to show that the climate deniers whole stance is not even about the earth or the future, it is about advancing their own political agenda. Enacting government control for climate change rings too close to socialism-esque larger government and that goes against the republican stance. However climate change should not even be an issue debated by politicians. This is a scientific fact not a divided political issue. Anyone who is not a scientist should not be able to rally and entire 'cult' of climate deniers. They are not climate deniers, they are science deniers. These politicians should not be so concerned with furthering their agenda because it won't even matter when we all burn to death in a huge fire in a matter of years. These climate denier politicians are just cherry-picking data and using anecdotal evidence to say that climate change is not real. However, that's not how real science works. You cannot just bend data to fit your views and pass it off to all your followers as scientific fact. This reminds me of the anti-vaccine 'science'. That entire anti-vax movement is based of off one piece of anecdotal evidence. Unfortunately many Americans are just sheep who go along with anything they hear or read, even if it goes against YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES AND HARD DATA. Cherry-picking and anecdotal evidence is not science. It's just not. Every single reason the white men in this video give to support their stance that climate change is not real are based off of no actual science or conducted studies. They also seem to not understand that if a scientific study happens to be released to the public that it has gone through many rounds of peer review by other scientists and the studies have been repeated multiple times. Scientific studies are not just an opinion released by one person, it is a collaborative, peer-reviewed collection of hard data and analysis.
 <br><br>
Also, since when did believing in God have anything to do with scientific fact? Calling climate scientists “godless liberals” is absolutely ridiculous to me. It seems that recently every single American has forgotten that separation of church and state is written in our Constitution! For this argument we will group climate change as a political issue even though it should not be. People bring religion into so many political issues when it is stated in the Constitution of the United States of America that bringing church to politics is not allowed. I would go so far as to say that denying climate based on the reason that climate scientists are “godless liberals” is very un-American *gasp*. This demographic of people are the same ones saying that gun control would be violating our constitution. I guess that means they are just a bunch of hypocrites. They violate the constitution whenever they bring religion to the table as an argument in a political debate or any political setting. You cannot pick and choose which rules to follow. Just like how you cannot pick and choose which data gets presented. The climate crisis is real and it's here.

  After watching "A Climate of Doubt" I realized there is a lot more behind climate change skepticism than I thought. These skeptics are denying and tampering science, just to maintain the interests of fossil fuel companies and themselves. Most of these skeptics, including Chris Monckton, aren’t even scientists, but they know how to campaign. I think it was interesting that a lot of the same people trying to deny climate change were also on the campaigns supporting tobacco industries. This demonstrates that these skeptics are taking on the front roles of defending large corporations that are trying to prevent legislation that would take away their money. These skeptics are being paid off by companies who would lose significant amounts of money. So these skeptics will do anything to keep the money coming in from these companies. And these companies will also do so anonymously to protect their image, through trusts like Donors Trust. One of the most frustrating things for me to watch was the manipulation of data and presenting it in a matter that is skewed. The public needs to be smarter and look into the whole picture being presented, because then they would see each decade is getting hotter and hotter instead of just looking at certain periods where cooling occurs. It is crazy to listen to the 3% of one side over the 97% percent of qualified scientists. 
 <br><br>

One thing that interested me was that all or most of these skeptics were old white men, who are not going to be the ones who face the effects of climate change in the future. Their only focus is on the present, and their concern in the present is their own economic interest. This also began to translate into the public with the 2008 recession and the cap and trade bill. No one wants a bill that is going to impose more taxes and potentially kill jobs during a time of economic hardship and financial struggles. This is when the public started to latch onto everything that the skeptics were saying because they want to believe climate change is not something we are responsible for, because the actions required to fix it would negatively affect them.

  The documentary "Merchants Of Doubt" creates a great comparison between magic show and fossil fuel companies. The conjure can distract the audience, so that they won't notice the trick played by the magician and won't discover the truth. Likewise, these fossil fuel industries fund deniers to public scientific article and successfully confuse the government and public, so they can continue to make profit to the last second. Though I know the greedy nature of human and how avarice can affect people, it is still mournful when hearing such news. When the incoming catastrophe faced by all human beings and urgently required the union of all, some are, unexpectedly, putting obstacle on the path just for protecting their own interest. Actually, the increasing number of people are being aware of the situation several years ago. If the tendency continue going like this, for now we may already mitigated some damages. However, because of some selfish people, the opinion of public is changing. Many now doubt the authenticity of anthropogenic climate change factors and even government begin ignoring the issue. It is strange that people don't  believe the conclusion of hard work of scientists, but rather truth the words based on self-interests of the companies. One of the characteristics of science is that is can be falsified. The simple conclusion that human factors play a small rule on climate change requires years of study and tons of money to do researches to overthrow the idea. I believe it is a waste of time to tangled in the view that whether human has influenced the climate now. Since there is not much time lest, we'd better take actions right now to save our future and all the spices on the planets. As an individual without great influence on public, I can still make tiny effort to help the Earth, and I believe all these tiny effects gather together can make a huge different in our life.

  After watching this film, I was astonished by the opinions and comments proposed by some American political leaders. I cannot understand why they framed those scientists by saying the science data is inconclusive. People can observe that the world is changing, and we must do something to stop what is happening right now. Deforestation, air pollution, ice melting, and a series of the phenomenon are related to climate change. We are experiencing the consequence that climate change brought to us right now. For instance, Chinese citizens need to wear masks to prevent smog in their city. The air pollution and overrated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere threats our life. I agree with Coral Davenport’s opinion, which suggests that climate change is the biggest global, economic, and political problem, but just not on the American political radar. The leaders should set an example to his followers. What we see and observe is the truth, and it is no doubt that anyone should pay attention to that. Everyone must have an awareness of the issue of climate change. I strongly recommend this film to those who want to have a different and political view regarding the climate change problem in 2012.

 The movie "Merchants of Doubt" really opened my eyes and surprised me that the tobacco companies sell cigarettes to people trying to get them addicted in order to make more profit. They hide the fact from the public and conceal the danger harmful effect of cigarettes. There is similarity between tobacco industry and and climate skepticism. There are both interest behind the politicians or merchants who tries to deny the scientific fact to support their interests. The reason why people sometime doubts the fact is not only because of the misleading information of politicians, but also that the scientists are not communicating the scientific fact well to the public as they find the evidence and the truth.

  It took 49 seconds to recognize the complete hypocrisy of the climate deniers… or maybe my temper is short with them. It still amazes me that there are still people who doubt the facts. So how did climate change become such a political issue? Well that’s simple Politicians, public figures, and pseudoscientists are are driven by capitalism and will say anything for money using broad strategies to make people uncertain. As the documentary states, fossil fuels are a major contributor to the economy and it is the unextracted fossil fuels that hold the monetary value. A Climate of Doubt redefines politics of global warming. People view the climate crisis as phantom issues where the climate is going to naturally change. While yes, the climate does naturally change over time, these current conditions are getting too extreme and are not in the right times of the year. Skeptics are using broad strategies to make people uncertain and strategies used by the tobacco company. One important point to mention is that the skeptics have a seat at the table, meaning they have incredible influence in the political sphere. Climate deniers are using data albeit, but its selective data; a portion of the bigger picture. Take the example given in the PBS documentary when they referred to the overall cooling trends. Yes the earth has cooling periods, but this years cooling period is warmer than the last. Emails are taken out of context causing the climate game and republicans who hold the power of decisions are dismissing any questions by the reporters.   Despite all of the skeptics and their “evidence”, scientists have yet to find any evidence that suggests otherwise of the climate crisis.

  I really liked how Merchants of Doubt presented the Climate Crisis issue. They connected the Tobacco industry with the Fossil Fuel Industry to show how the same styles of manipulation was being employed by the same people. Even the little moments when they would show magicians added to it. Magicians are meant to fool the public into believing one thing and that is exactly what the climate deniers who are bribed by oil companies are doing. At first, I was really shocked by how many companies had ties to the Tobacco and Oil industry, but now I think it makes sense. Those two industries are, or at least were, the richest in the world so of course, other businesses would align themselves with them. The movie kept making me think about Ken’s analogy of the cigarette because now we really have the connection on full display. What was really striking to me was that anyone who actually took the time to look at the data was convinced that climate change is real, for instance, the republican politician and the skeptic magazine owner were both originally deniers until they actually did their research. I think that if we educate the public and show them all of this evidence, that they too would be unable to deny the reality of the situation. This also leads me to believe that climate deniers are simply not taking the time to actually see if climate change is real or not because they are so set on the scientists being wrong.
  <br><br>

The climate deniers manipulation doesn’t stop there, they even go as far as to distort the data and claim that it says something else. They literally say whatever to gain the public’s favor; they can blatantly say that the climate crisis isn’t real and then the next day say it is real but that it would cost billions of dollars. Marc Morano, one of the climate deniers, makes it seem like a joke. He laughs about sending death threats to scientists and that he manipulates people. It is really disgusting that people like him have so much power over others. What is funny is that people say the scientists exaggerate, but the fact of the matter is that there is overpopulation, there are billions of people starving, there are rainforests disappearing, and the US is dealing with consequences. 
 <br><br>
It really sucks that people time and time again, have to make the climate issue into a political one when in reality it should be one of humanity. The climate crisis does not discriminate and will not leave any part of the world untouched. All of humanity will be affected by the climate crisis, and if we don’t do anything it could really become an apocalyptic catastrophe.

  “You win on the politics you win on the science?”
 <br><br>
“I think so. I do.”
 <br><br>
That’s all you needed to hear to understand the standpoint of the climate change deniers who changed the political landscape for climate change between 2012 and 2016. All it took was a few skeptical people and some fossil fuel interest groups, and suddenly the fight was no longer about denying the science of climate change. It was about winning the political battle to convince people their standing was right, even with barely any scientific basis behind it. All they need is the political willpower to convince people of their position. The British speaker who appeared multiple times throughout the documentary didn’t even have scientific credentials. People already did not trust the government due to the economic crisis in 2009. This crisis made it ridiculously easy to convince people to not trust the government, including the scientists who worked for it. Climate change deniers politicized the issue as well. With a Democratic president in the White House, the deniers painted environmentalism as radical leftism, causing more people to not want to align themselves with environmentalists, who were politically opposite of them.
 <br><br>


It wasn’t always political. Many Republicans prior to 2009 were believers in anthropogenic climate change. Money changes things fast. With fossil fuel companies spending money on think tanks who raised grassroot skepticism of climate change, politicians had to heed the skepticism of their constituents or risk being voted out of office. It’s absolutely ridiculous how much money decides our policies. Our democracy is being bought out by large-amount donors, and climate change is being legislated away by politicians on the receiving end of that money. Outspoken skeptics are overpowering scientists who are trying to provide facts. Still today, report after report of the upcoming devastating effects on our climate if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed continue to be released by scientists, but many popular news networks give it no attention, and many politicians refute it outright or refuse to answer questions about it. So many people leading the deniers of climate change don’t care about the science. All they have to do is win the politics.

 I  agree with your view point of the climate change deniers. What is sad is that these people are banking on the fact that much of America is uneducated in regards to climate change. Would we commend someone for confusing a 4 year old child into believing that 2+2=5? No, so then why do people pay others so much to confuse the public about climate change and the science behind it? This happens because of money like you said. Rather than genuinely caring about the issues that will become a reality through anthropogenic climate change, people care about how much money is in their wallets. Even though climate change is real the fossil fuel company is going to do anything they can to keep making money even if that means continuing to harm our planet. Politics, although manipulated for monetary gain, is still ran by the views of the people. If you can confuse the people, you can sway politics, and disregard science. At least this is what deniers believe.

<br><hr>
I agree with both of you. It is crazy that so many people in power not only ignore but blatantly deny the facts of climate change. The purpose is only in the name of getting money as these people are funded by companies like Exxon. It was frustrating to see that politicians literally changed their views after getting money from large oil corporations. I agree with you, Savannah, that they are banking on the fact that much of the US population is uneducated in climate science. That’s why their major goal is not even to prove a hypothesis but to confuse their audience.
<br><hr>
I agree that climate change deniers focus more on winning the politics to gain the attention of those who have no background on this topic. It is quite naive of Americans to be listening to and believing speakers with no scientific background. Christpher Monckton is a British journalist who said himself to have no true knowledge to back up his claims. Even after he made aware of his limited background, his ability to project his voice to large groups of people in a persuasive way influenced spectators’ minds to a point that mitigated the human effects of climate change. The fact that this type of public speaking was one of the biggest ways of diminishing human response to climate change is really discouraging. 
  <br><br>

In regards to the Oregon Climate Petition, how can a physicist such as Fred Singer claim that such a petition was a reliable source if numerous people who signed it consisted of individuals with no specialization in this field? To push this even further, celebrities were part of the group who signed this petition as well, which really questions the validity of the decisions being made. Is science practically plain out being denied in this case? 
  <br><br>

The Climate Gate was even more questioning to me. Picking out climate scientists and professors to search through their emails is completely absurd, and almost childish in a sense. How can emails be used to determine the justifiability of another person’s claim. Emails are meant to be personal and confidential from one person to another, and not used for any data or scientific research. The fact that climate change deniers are solely picking out claims/data in emails from climate scientists that relate to their viewpoints is crass.
  <br><br>

It doesn’t matter if what you’re doing makes a profit or not. In the end, climate change will have affected all life forms on earth, and none of these conflicting views will matter, nor will monetary profit. Along the coast, an interviewee states that the ocean is what will dictate whether sea levels are rising or not, and how it will impact the climate. In the end, the ocean will win. The people who deny this environmental change will always be people who specialize in getting messages out to the world, who know how to be persuasive. They are using such tactics to reel in the support of the average human, and using it as leverage against climate change.
<br><hr>
I agree with everyone above. It is scary that an issue like this is so political, and it is amazing how people with no credentials in the field can convince so many that they know better than trained professionals. The power of public speaking seems to know no bounds. Watching “Climate of Doubt” reminded me a little bit of the 2016 election. Donald Trump also had no credentials, but somehow managed to resonate with so many people. With enough money and power, it seems one can do anything. As many of you mentioned above, these types of people are pandering to the uneducated, and turning them against the experts. It is honestly just evil. Because they don’t care about the people they are lying to, and they have no interest in educating them. It is unbelievably infuriating and heart breaking to think that this entire sector of climate change deniers essentially only exists because oil tycoons couldn’t stand the idea of not being billionaires. Do those people not think about the lives of their future grandchildren? Do they truly believe what they say? I am pretty convinced it’s just greed that drives them, but perhaps they are lead by conviction. Either way, it drives me mad.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with what you said about how it only took a few doubts to bring the progress on the climate crisis to a halt. There are a couple of issues underlining this: first, the nature of some news organizations to treat every issue as a debate with two equally valid sides (centrism), and also the continually strengthening partisan gridlock within Congress. The appeal of climate change denial is one of inertia, since it tells the American people that they can continue living their same lifestyle without concern. Even if there were future consequences, climate change deniers are often an older demographic, especially the Senators who deny it (average age of a Senator is 61.8 years), meaning the consequences are far beyond them anyways. On the issue of partisanship, Senators like Mitch McConnell have drastically worsened the landscape. Many of Obama's main policies were in fact quite centrist (ObamaCare) along with his Supreme Court nomination, where in the latter case, the Senate simply refused to vote (i.e. do their jobs). The same thing happened with what used to be a bipartisan push for environmentalist policies. The very nature of conservatism is to prevent change (going back to inertia), so when a major shift towards green energy was beginning to take place, conservatives naturally revolted. 
  <br><br>


The money is what the issue truly followed, however, regardless of what Congress actually believed. Donor organizations and "think tanks" like those in the film are responsible for creating most of the doubt. Large donors like Exxon get a middle man to keep large donations towards climate change denial private. Credentials are getting sold to these think tanks to give them some sense of credibility despite undertaking thoroughly unscientific investigations (finding evidence to reach a conclusion). An example is the physicist who likely never studied climate science in his career, but was asked to spout climate change denial anyways. Someone in lecture made an excellent point about this: we live in a world of specialization, and we need to listen to the experts of a field (where 97% consensus has been reached on anthropogenic climate change). Like it was mentioned in the film, if 98 doctors told you to treat your child one way, and 2 doctors said to do the opposite, it's very obvious what the course of action is.

<br><hr>
 I agree with your points. I feel the same that it is not denials from the skeptics but from politicians who stand behind these skeptics. To figure out who are the skeptics, we can see from people related to them. All the fossil fuels companies, politicians, and investors on fossil fuels have close connections with the skeptics. Like you said, these people aim to win a battle, a political battle. It is also a shameful event that scientists who oppose man-made climate crisis are easily bribed by money. It is money that brings these people together and drives them to do bad things against their consciences.  After I watched the film, I feel sad because all I see is ugly faces that crazily propaganda every citizen in order to convince each citizen choosing their side. I hope that in the future, more and more people will not be misled by the skeptics and make the right choice.

<br><hr>

Correction: the physicist (Fred Singer) specialized in atmospheric physics. This does not exclude the possibility of his credentials being paid for, or him simply being the 2% of scientists not within the consensus.

  When people say that money cannot buy everything, I wonder if that statement holds true. The reason I say this is because wherever money is, power comes. No more is this true than during the climate change crisis. When fossil fuel industries and special interest groups buy the mouths of the politicians, it brings to the stage the idea that climate change is not real. And the regular citizen will not know where these words are coming from or how these words are bought, but regardless, if they see a representative say this, then they will automatically put the thought into their head. The price of power is not cheap, but fossil fuel industries need to pay for the policies to be put into place. 

  <br><br>

I really enjoy the analogy that Ken uses when it comes to the bank. He equates the remaining fossil fuel industries that are locked into the ground as a $100 in the bank. Not using the remainder of the fossil fuels underground would be as if you can only use $12 of the $100 in the bank, and logically, this would make anyone upset. And there is a good point that can be made when it regards the economics of it. Economists tend to think in the moment. They do not care about the yesterday/month/year, they do not particularly hold sentiment for the morrow either. However, what they mostly care about is the now. And, in the moment, it makes sense to maximize the profit of gas and oil companies by utilizing all the resources at their disposable because it would be economically inefficient not to. To that point, I completely understand. 
  <br><br>


However, what I completely disagree with is the idea of coercion, and especially the coercion of the American population. A great example of this would be the 2012 election. When Mitt Romney ran against Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election, climate change was rare in their policy exchange (which was noted within the film). This incident can be attributed to the special interest groups, such as American for Prosperity. Through funding, either through larger believers of the anti-climate movement or underground, unknown donors, such as Donorstrust, these special interest groups have been able to run their own agenda and bring doubt into the American public when, in the previous election cycle, these facts seemed to be crystal clear. When asked about the climate change crisis, scientists that side with AFP have acknowledged that they are the 3% out of the remaining 100% who believe that the signs that climate change is caused by man do not exist. And yes, there is an argument to be made that scientists are persuaded by the leftist ideologies. But, a clear consensus is a clear consensus. The predictions that have been made about the effects of the climate are coming to fruition. Yet, even today, there exist conservatives who refuse to acknowledge the effects of climate change.
  <br><br>


Coercion. This is pure coercion. In the film, they said that people who are working with “stuff” (which closely translates to people who work closest to the Earth’s raw materials) have believed that climate change does not exist. They use this as a credible source. Scientists have said that they believe that the climate rises and falls frequently, and all we can do is just “wait.” But that’s the thing. It does not matter if they believe in climate change or not. It does not matter if they see unicorns as horses or pigs as flying. However, it matters when it blocks policymakers from taking action. It matters when there is no legislation being passed. It matters when the government is locked down by fossil fuel companies. Today, we see it most, with an administration denies the existence of climate change (which is one of the worst parts of the American democracy because a policy is always partisan-based, but that’s for a different time). And the special interest groups only feed into politicians’ heads, causing this inaction.

I think you unfairly attack Economists here. As an econ major, I can tell you that climate change is a concern and that economists are not necessarily pro-fossil fuel industries. Yes, economists are concerned by the short-run and the maximization of profits. But economists are more and more interested (and to be fair have always been) with the long run and the challenges posed by climate change. I wouldn't disregard Economics in the way you do, since Economists can be of valuable assistance in making a durable and economically rational ecological transition.

  At the beginning of Professor Ken’s video, he said that the climate crisis will cause millions of hundreds of people to become refugees and animals to become extinct. It is really terrible to hear about that. I was shocked when I watched these two movies since it told me that climate change is not caused by human activity. Some people even think that global warming is a good thing for our planet and is necessary because carbon dioxide is food for plants and global warming carbon dioxide helps plants to grow. In the past, many books or news stated that our pollution has destroyed our environment and caused global warming. However, Christopher Monckton says that there has been no global warming for fifteen years. There are a lot of scientists using data, and their professional knowledge to present climate change is not a serious issue as we thought before. They think science is being hyped global warming. Also, there is another group of scientists that illustrates human activity can cause climate change in many ways. One of them, Al Gore, who shares the Nobel Peace Prize, is the perfect proponent of global warming. From my perspective, we cannot deny that global warming exists, and greenhouse gas is accelerating every day. The greenhouse effect can truly influence global temperature, but how big it affects is what we don’t know. I agree with both scientists who support climate change is caused by humans and opponents. There is no matter why climate change exists or global warming is happening, more importantly, we should protect our environment and pay more attention to this issue.

  Watching merchant of doubt was really eye opening to see just how deep the conspiracy against climate change really goes. It’s still hard for me to believe that there are select individuals in this country who knowingly corrupt public knowledge when it comes to climate science just for a profit. I know there are billions of dollars at stake but with the amount of evidence supporting anthropogenic climate change you would think that fossil fuel companies would try to adjust for the future because mother nature will prevail when push comes to shove.
  <br><br>
Both climate of doubt and merchant of doubt are enlightening movies that everyone should watch to get a better understanding of how the climate change argument has been corrupted in politics.



</p><hr>


<p>
  Merchants of Doubt gave an inside view of how the scientists describe and defend their stance. I was shocked to see the number of climate deniers there still are. According to Fred Singer there are hundreds and thousands of them out there. Even if that is an overstatement, the film features some skeptics that caught my attention. People who deny that human induced climate change is happening rather say that they do not know the cause of climate change is. Marc Marano seems to be a potent character in this climate fiasco. He is very strong in his opinion and seems to be having fun with it. He finds joy in sending death threats and apparently won't stop sending scientists hateful emails. He, himself, enjoys getting them. What kind of sick person enjoys hate mail? He needs to screw his head on tight to realize it is not fun and games and the consequences of CO2 are upon us. He will not be laughing when his home or loved-ones are hit by a climate disaster and the earth self-destructs. 
  <br><br>

I also found it interesting when the man from Americans for Prosperity talked about how he does not talk about the science of it all, but rather just the economics. To me, that sounds ridiculous. You cannot just focus on one and neglect the other.  By focusing on the economics one must take into consideration the science. For example, if we lay off of fossil fuels, which indeed makes our world as advanced and developed as it is today,  we can keep our developed world, but switch to wind and solar energies. These new energies discovered by science will create jobs fostering economic growth in total. Yes, there will be losses in the fossil fuel industry, however, it is better to lose money in one industry than to pump hazardous gas into our atmosphere that will end up destroying homes and lives. 
  <br><br>

Lastly, I think that this picking sides of believers and skeptics should not be a matter of conservative and liberal. As Bob Inglis has shown, it is possible to be conservative, but believe in climate change. He is one of the few who does not take a side premeditated by his party identification. Instead, Bob separates this issue from all of that and looks at the science and realizes that the facts do not lie. It saddens me that he receives negative feedback for doing so and does not get re-elected. In my mind, Inglis was doing the right thing.

  When watching “Merchants of Doubt” I was very surprised on how some people's motives are to just confuse their listeners on whether the climate crisis is a real thing or not. There's a lot of  people on both sides of this argument. I feel like throughout ENGL 22 and up until this point, I have just witnessed people whose motives are completely against climate change or who ignore the problem altogether. I feel that these people’s intentions are more effective than completely disagreeing with climate change because they are confusing audiences and being undecided on an issue can make them completely disregard the issue. I also feel that this film was very interesting because in the past we have not looked into the arguments opposed to climate change. We know that climate change is real because there is actual evidence to support it, but I find it somewhat sad when people try to argue with climate activists and just repeatedly say that it is not an issue without stating any facts or stating completely wrong facts and that there are supporters based on a single claim. I also found it very sad, on the issue of tobacco where they believed that the fires were caused because of the furniture and not the cigarette smoke. I also found it sad that the man in the film won a case in favor of cigarettes because he made up a story of a baby dying in a crib because the mother left a candle in it. It is sad that people lie for something that is not going to be good for the public. They would not have to lie if the cigarettes guaranteed safety. Those who are against climate change, just do not want to look at the facts or even consider them, they just want to stick to their statement that climate change is not real. They are not willing to listen to experts on this issue. Also, some of the people in this film stick to their notion that climate change is not an issue because they are being paid by fossil fuel companies. Confusing the public about this issue is just going to make them disregard it more than they already do because they will not want to pick a side of this argument if they have no statistics  and those that are mentioned in the film are not giving them any credible ones.

I completely agree with your comment. It's really frustrating so see that there's so many "scientists" who make very smug claims that thousands of scientists agree that climate change isn't real using the Oregon Petition as their only source of evidence when in reality, people signed names such as "the Spice Girls" and "Michael J. Fox" on the document to prove how much of a joke it is. I think it would be really interesting to see if any of these people's opinions would change if they just really took a look at the data that has been collected for decades. Would their opinions change? Or, have they known the truth all along and are too overcome with greed to care enough?

 I have always wondered what goes through the minds of people who live in today's world and don’t believe in human-caused climate change, have I been missing some integral aspect of the climate conversation? Perhaps there is some legitimate research out there that I just haven’t seen yet that proves that the climate crisis is a hoax fabricated by scientists with ulterior motives. After watching the film A Climate of Doubt, I have come to some conclusions: 1) important scientific information about climate change is not being withheld from me or anyone else and 2) people who are doing everything in their power to convince the public that the climate crisis is bogus simply don't care about the environment or about future generations and instead wish to focus their energy on money and politics and tangible goods.
  <br><br>
 It was mind boggling to watch people confidently say that somehow 97% of the climate science community is straight up wrong and that all of the abnormal weather patterns and extreme heat waves and droughts and floods are not signs of an unhealthy planet, in fact they're indications that everything is completely fine! I think the message of the film was a very important one, in that many don't realize that there was an abrupt end to the public conversation about climate change by politicians after the 2008 recession hit. Although there has been a recent surge in politicians willing to talk about climate change and advocate for eco-friendly policies, it is almost too little, too late. The effects of climate change are all around us and time is truly running out before it is literally too late to prevent these effects from worsening. People can't always expect politicians to have their best interest in mind, and if something as important as climate change has been pushed under the rug by our so-called "leaders", it's up to us (students, activists, scientists, concerned citizens) to start creating the change we want to see.

Going off of your response, I as well have been wondering what goes through the minds of these people who are advocating that climate change is not happening. After watching this film and reading the article for the week I was able to come to a conclusion as well which is that people are easily persuaded to do anything when their mindset is revolved around greed. It is mind boggling to think that 97% of scientists can claim they have the proof that this climate crisis is in full affect, yet the people who believe this is a hoax are so determined with the "facts" the other 3% has. Something that I hadn't really realized before this film was how speaking of climate change has the potential of ruining your political career if you are Republican. I would understand there could be a different of opinions but when I saw what happened to South Carolina Congressman Bob Inglis it really forced me to be aware of the severity of how climate change rules politics as well. There is no room for conversation about this within the Republican party (from what it seems like) which is extremely detrimental to the future of our planet because thats a large portion of our government that needs to be on board in order to make progressive and life saving decisions. It is definitely up to us as students, activists, scientists and concerned citizens, like you said, to create the change we want to see. However it feels like we are so far away from being able to actually implement a plan of action because there is at least 20 years until we can remove these greedy corporate individuals from office. If we live in a society where people turn their heads away from a 97% to 3% statistic I really don't know what will be significant enough to make them listen and or change.

  In regards to the film “Climate of Doubt” I was constantly confused. This film largely focuses on the standpoint of global warming skeptics and how they view this issue, and I truly had trouble understanding their viewpoint. For the beginning of the film I was just waiting for some actual evidence to appear, showing that global warming is a hoax since the majority of the film was talking about people’s opinion. The film also heavily emphasized that this debate about the climate crisis being real or not is very political and showed how politicians get their viewpoint across to the public. 
  <br><br>

The only piece of evidence that was shown, proving that there has been no global warming, was a graph made by Fred Singer. However, it was also proven that the way his graph was modeled was altering the actual facts of how much the earth has warmed and that other graphs made by actual scientists show the extreme effects of global warming. But, it was quickly brought up that scientists are not to be trusted with this information. People believe that scientists are getting paid to alter data to make it look like the climate crisis is something to be worried about. However, how does one actually prove that these scientists are fabricating evidence? Why would they want to control the data? 97-98% of scientists believe that the climate crisis is real, so how is this even an argument? 
  <br><br>

The film also included the fact that many Americans became upset from the cap and trade that President Obama put into place in order to help stop global warming. Doing so meant that the American people would have to be taxed and jobs would have to be lost in order to put that money in to saving the earth. Obviously, people don’t like to be taxed and want to keep their jobs so this upset them, causing them to call science a hoax so that they can keep their money. We see this same issue over and over again about how humans would rather live conveniently than sustainably. Professor Hiltner even states that these people are “fighting for their financial needs rather than for the needs of the planet.” In this case, individuals do not want to sacrifice their tax money to save future generations.

I agree with you in that I was also contantly confused. I felt like they were jumping from different ideas and it did not allow me to fully understand the bigger picture. They were almost running in circles and defining things redundantly. When you mentioned the piece of evidence shown about how there has been no global warming, I remember watching that part and thinking: okay...is that the best they have? It seemed as so that the arguments were weak and had many things about them that just did not add up. Also, it is insane to me that politicians choose to argue over scientific fact. Not everything needs to be political, and this is one of those things. This is the climate, not a business. I think there needs to be a line drawn where politicians must accept that they cannot control everything that is happening in the world.


<br><hr>
While the arguments and viewpoints shown were very confusing, I also found “A Climate of Doubt” a very interesting and eye-opening documentary to watch because of how it showed the perspective of the other side. It’s shocking to hear how people justify their climate change-denying beliefs and even recruit scientists to back their false claims, arguing that climate change isn’t a “scientific consensus” but a political one. The fact that there has been such a massive shift in public opinion on the causes of climate change in only a couple of decades is very worrying, and it goes to show how much propaganda and false information is being spread without fact-checking. The graph Fred Singer made about cooling trends was particularly laughable to me, because while someone can pick any start point and end point that shows a decreasing temperature trend and argue to the public that global warming isn’t happening, if you take a look at the long-term data, temperatures are indisputably rising at a dangerous rate. Misinformation such as this is what has blinded many people to the truth of climate change. The way politicians and the media portrayed what is known as Climategate to the general public is also dangerous and irresponsible; they are taking a scientific truth and turning it into a partisan cause to divide people’s opinions on the matter. I’m also confused about how people try to defend and rationalize their beliefs that scientists are fabricating evidence of climate change. It’s unthinkable to me to ignore what 97% of scientists are saying and only listen to the few that are recruited by corrupt organizations such as the Heartland Institute. 
  <br><br>
It’s very disheartening to realize that most people just don’t care about the long-term sustainability of our planet if it negatively affects their finances. Implementing a carbon tax or investing in green technology would go a long way in making our planet better for future generations, but many people aren't interested in thinking long-term if it is inconvenient.
<br><hr>
After reading your comment, Kathleen, I realize that you're right. They had no other evidence than saying in simple terms, "maybe you're wrong" to the 97% of organizations and climate scientists that have found sound evidence that climate change is occurring. And if the climate deniers/Heartland Institute's main argument is instilling doubt of maybe the experts are wrong and are instilling fear, why can't those who believe in the factual basis of climate change argue the same thing. Maybe the deniers are wrong. To truly be convinced that there can be doubt makes me want to see some facts. The cooling trend graph that the Heartland Institute's "researchers" use is so obviously inaccurate. I like how credible scientists have given this TACTIC (not trend/fact) a name: going down the upwards escalator. This tactic of messaging goes to show that data can be manipulated in any way you want it to be, but it's important to only make conclusions that support the big picture as well as the details. 
  <br><br>


I think it's really interesting the our perception of climate change is dictated so heavily by messaging, funding, and political influence. The way data is presented, the way the people that fund us influence what these organizations say to us, and the way a party or a single ideal can influence so many of our opinions on different issues says a lot about why political affiliation causes us to think and act the way that we do. What's even more interesting is that the Heartland Institute is letting their ideals on "free market" affect a public health, national security climate crisis. Even though I see that they are saying environmental regulations like the cap and trade affect their  previous "free market" other things in within our government have regulations (trade etc.) Why start attacking something as life threatening and global as this. 
  <br><br>


Overall, I think this film, while confusing from the Heartland's perspective as times, did a good job of not entirely "villianizing" the deniers, but instead showing viewers how, for a lack of better words, unconvincing and baseless their opinions are. I left the film feeling pretty angry and riled up, especially when learning that the Koch brothers back these initiatives. I left this film feeling more educated than before and am interested to learn what basis these deniers have in their argument.


<br><hr>

I agree with you, Kathleen. This film was kind of straying from the problem of climate change. The evidence and statistics showing the human impact on climate change are true but the fact that people have to find a way to disprove this information is so biased. In the movie, the president of the National Academy of Sciences stated: "Virtually every place on earth is warming up. And people who have tried to go back and scrub the data — like, is there a mistake with the way they're making these measurements — they've all concluded, no, the people who are doing this work at the key places around the world are agreeing with each other." The only example that showed that there is no global warming is from Fred Singer. I feel the same way with you that scientists are getting paid to alter data because the evidence is there and the information is being censored to twist the audience. 

  <br><br>

That last point you made in your last paragraph is so disappointing to hear that from the human population. Either way, we are taxed every year and that money goes into bettering things like highways and jobs but the construction of this phenomenon is adding to the greenhouse effect but people are too ignorant to pax taxes to help better climate change. If people wanted a way to help climate change, then the cap and trade would have been an efficient way of doing so but instead, people see it as a way of "the government taking our money."

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement of feeling confused during the duration of this film “Climate of Doubt.” The organization of the entire piece felt as though it was jumping from person to person to see what is their opinion on climate change. However, this piece seems to be based around opinions in general since many of the people who believe that climate change is not real said that the 97% of scientists' consensus was all just their opinion. It’s as though they just thought that scientists were disregarding all scientific data and just making a guess that humans were causing climate change because they had a hunch. 
  <br><br>


What made me most frustrated about this film was the amount of power these climate change deniers had due to their impact on government officials such as Congress members. When hearing about how Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, simply ignored the question “do you think climate change is causing the earth to become warmer,” it made me furious. How could someone so important in the process of helping the United States become a cleaner resource country just ignore this kind of question? Additionally, many Republican congress members simply would avoid answering Coral Davenport’s three simple questions that revolved around their opinions on climate change and how we could help it. I would think that if they were really confident in their opinions on whether or not they believe in climate change that they would be willing to express that opinion. But I guess they do not feel confident in anyone’s opinions; not their own or skilled scientists’.
<br><hr>
I would say that I was also confused throughout the film “Climate of Doubt”. There were some parts that caught my attention, meanwhile, other parts had me lost on what was going on. What amazed me was how people with no scientific qualifications can make a crowd believe there is no climate change, just like Christopher Monckton, a journalist. People begin to deny climate change due to the ways that they present the facts, such as the Climategate, where it was said that the scientists had altered data and people began to say it was all a  conspiracy.

  <br><br>

I would also agree that the only statistic they provided was the chart, which they consider cooling trends during certain periods, but if you look at the entire chart, you see an upward trend showing that the earth is warming. This film simply shows us how people are trying to avoid knowing what is really happening. The members of Congress would prevent the topic from coming up by saying they would not answer the question. When reporter, Coral Davenport asked three simple and straightforward questions they would run away as if they don’t really know anything about the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I felt the same exact way in that during the whole video I was confused. When I found out we were going to be learning about the other side, the people who did not believe in climate change I was eager to learn why. At first I was more disappointed watching this video and hearing opinion after opinion, the lack of evidence was frustrating to me. But after awhile I realized that there’s no evidence presented because there is no evidence for their opinions. And that this video focused on the tactics that they used to lie to the public. Their tactics show how anything can be manipulated to seem so convincing. And I also found it interesting how easy the public's opinion was able to be pseuded. The public's thoughts are so heavily influenced by politics and funding, it’s almost scary. The way public figures and media are advocating climategate to the public is dangerous as it is, they're taking scientific truth and having people choose sides over it. Climate change is not a political matter, but yet politicians are managing to gain supporters and media attention over it??? This is beyond frustrating, when will people see the day to day evidence of climate change and do something about it, particularly americans. Americans find any excuse to say climate change is not real to avoid the inconvenience it might place on their lives. I’m ready to get to the part of the course that includes on how we can help the planet. We know its real, 97% of scientists know it is real, so how do we fix it, how do we slow it, whats next ken??
<br><hr>
I can relate to your opinion, as this documentary made me heated due to fake news, faulty science, and fighting in politics. 
  <br><br>
Why do people doubt the consensus of 97% of scientists who specialize in a vast array of fields and researching this topic together well more than a common person in disbelief can study in their entire lifetime. I do not understand the viewpoints of those deniers. What evidence do they believe that is not altering graph data or climate-gate. The opposition consists of powerful, influential speakers are entitled to their own opinion. Since they know their viewpoints are wrong, they should keep it to themselves. However, I have a problem when they are working to slow/stop the movement of global warming, exploiting the fears of people because it is hard and inconvenient to tackle a global issue. Certain politician's campaign power comes from a heard of sheep, persuaded by corrupt communication skills. It’s unethical to capitalize on the negative sacrifices our country must make to resolve the mass damage and destruction. Obviously, people would want to believe the climate crisis is fake, and anti-global warming leaders have taken advantage. Fighting for financial needs rather than the needs of the planet will selfishly take away our posterity's future. There will be no economy to regulate if the atmosphere continues to heat. Political wars and verbal civil wars over the verification of this issue are underway. These battles should be very lopsided in favor of science, but it scares me that mass amounts of people are trusting false information and the stubbornness of corrupt politicians. Climate change does not care about politics, so why are there so many internal political problems and different sides. 
  <br><br>
The damage these deterrents of opposing opinions are causing are wasting time. These acts to slow and derail the global warming movement are making the situation more catastrophic by the delay. It really annoys me that fossil fuel companies will continue their harm until legislation is implemented to ban carbon pollution. With the slow moving method of passing bills, there's potential for temperatures to raise even higher.

<br><hr>
I share your confusion after having watched this film. I also recognize the self-serving behavior of the American people when it comes to matters regarding climate change. People wanting to live conveniently rather than sustainably stems from society’s desire and demand for instant gratification. Changing your habits and transitioning to a sustainable lifestyle would not have direct and immediate results on improving the Earth’s climate and people know that. Most who are unconcerned about or don’t believe in anthropogenic climate change are conscious of the fact that if they were to change their actions, it wouldn’t have much of an impact on the world’s climate in their time on Earth. People would rather disregard climate change and pretend it isn’t a real issue than change their lifestyles into one that would disturb their comfort of living. This is a blatantly selfish mindset to possess--that is far too common in the United States--as they are aware that the consequences of climate change will not be of their concern when they are at their worst. Much like how Bob Inglis explains, to not believe in climate change is to take the advice of two doctors over that of 98 doctors in agreement when your child is in a state of sickness.
<br><hr>
I agree with you in that I was also confused while watching the film. At first, I was expecting to be presented with loads of evidence proving that the climate crisis is a hoax, but instead the film just emphasized that fact that it has now turned into an argument of opinions and political standings. After merely three weeks of this class, I have established my side on this argument and I was expecting this video to maybe sway me to the opposing side. Instead I found myself constantly wondering if that was all they had to prove that climate change isn't real. It seemed as though the arguments were at times very questionable and weak. I also find it so crazy that a politician, with no scientific background or credential, has enough power to change people's mind over a scientific fact. The evidence supporting climate change is concrete and researched and the evidence presented in this film against climate change was simply weak. The film itself kept jumping back and forth between sides and the differing ideas, so it was difficult for me to grasp the main point. When the movie finished, I was left with more questions of how this crisis has gone so far out of hand and why must all things be a political issue?
<br><hr>

I was also incredibly confused while watching "Climate of Doubt", as these groups of skeptics would sit in those interviews and act smug and laugh when asked questions about climate change, yet they couldn't ever really answer said questions. People with no scientific expertise, some being congressmen, sit there and genuinely believe that they are smarter than 97% of scientists and that they are saving the planet by doing nothing. Yet the only evidence they have is a cherry-picked, falsified graph to fear monger to the masses. Even if climate change wasn't real, and even if their ridiculous claims were accurate, why would you not want to save the planet? Why wouldn't you want a cleaner atmosphere, a cleaner ocean, and a better life for your children and grandchildren? This has always confused me and after watching this documentary I only grew more upset. Honestly, the most heartbreaking part of this special was when climate scientist Andrew Dessler is talking about groups asking for his information to fight his research, and Dessler's response was "nobody can ever say we didn't warn them". These "skeptics" only break down true science and spit out lies for the American public, and the worst part is that people believe it.

<br><hr>
Throughout this movie, what bothered me the most is how manipulative and ignorant people are about climate change to the point where they are completely blinded when the facts are right in front of them. At the same time, the film does a great job of capturing the sentiments and logic of the people who are so convinced that climate change isn’t real, though I have to agree that it was confusing to follow along sometimes. The parts I did understand were straight to the point, like how they showed their “data” as proof of climate cooling even though the scientists called it “going down the up escalator.” Climate change shouldn’t be political at all when it affects everyone right or left, religious or not, but in a country ran by money, the movie shows that it has. When North Carolina State Representative Bill Cook started calling carbon dioxide “a beautiful thing” for the world and its plants, it just emphasizes how much they focus on one bit of evidence from the large spectrum to satisfy their logic. I liked the comment climate scientist Gavin Shmidt made, regarding the beachfronts in North Carolina and how, "Those vulnerabilities don't go away because you legislate them away." Politicians can spend so much time going back and forth and until climate change hits them the way it hit Paradise, until it becomes a really bad problem when sea levels start to rise and the temperature drastically changes, they are going to just stick by their opinion. An opinion that allows them to selfishly continue with fossil fuels, slowly killing whatever hope we have left. The way the film begins to end, showing the shift from when politicians would talk about climate change to later when they wouldn't or simply deny it, I only hope that this upcoming election year that politicians won't do the same.
<br><hr>
I also agree that there was much lack of evidence and logical fallacies on the side of the climate change deniers. I think it is because climate change denial itself is reactionary. For example, the wave of climate change denial did not occur once scientists started talking about climate change, but rather once the political disadvantage it has on conservative groups started showing. There are several inconsistencies seen within climate change deniers shown in the film.
  <br><br>

Though climate change deniers argue that climate change believers create their data and findings grounded on politics, deniers actually do this to an extent that there was not much scientific evidence provided, but rather bashing on the other side. For example, climate change deniers at the conference grounded their denial on the advocation of the free market and no governmental regulation. As the film stated, opposing government regulation on climate change on the basis of protecting American liberty, is a perfect political match that could be used in the climate change argument. Climate change is therefore a political issue, and although deniers say that it shouldn't be, they are the ones that are creating their arguments based on that. It was frustrating to see that everything that the climate change deniers critique the climate change believers for is something that hey so explicitly do.
  <br><br>

One thing that upsets me is how wealthy entities of interest are able to manipulate the American public. Americans are misinformed and therefore would believe whatever is told to them if it seems to be in their own personal interest of liberty. For example, Obama's cap and trade approach received a lot of backlash because corporate entities were telling the public that it would negatively impact the economy. In addition, the way that climate change deniers manipulate data is really upsetting. For example, as you mentioned, the graph that showed global temperature going down, was actually manipulated in order to fir the narrative of the climate change hoax. This manipulation of data and miseducation of the public is not only seen in climate change, but other issues as well. For example, Fred Singer publicized data that supported that there were no health impacts to secondhand smoke. It is ridiculous to see how  financial interest motivates the distribution of politics and data. I think such people should be held accountable for spreading mass lies to the general public who rely on scientists and politicians to obtain information.
<br><hr>
I also found myself waiting for these politicians and climate change skeptics to come up with concrete evidence in their interviews. The entire documentary left me completely baffled as to how these politicians, without scientific knowledge, can stare at a set of data and conclude that purely because it goes against their economic interests, the data must be fake. The excerpt relating climate change to the illness of a child made me laugh when the politician asserted that he would chose the advice of two rogue doctors over 98 other doctors all agreeing on the same solution. It sounded like a recipe for disaster. What frustrates me even more is the fact that climate change denialists believe that the Oregon Petition is enough evidence to refute the statement that 97% of scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change when all that was required to sign it was a Bachelor's of Science. 
  <br><br>

All these falsehoods are compounded with the fact that these climate change denial movements are mostly funded by fossil fuel interests. It is ludicrous to believe that climate change believers want to intentionally hurt the economy by passing bills like the cap and trade. The goal of environmental policy is not to hurt the economy, but to protect the environment. No one wants to lose their jobs and no one wants a recession. However, the accusations that "green is the new red" are based upon this very misconception. The policies that are being put in place do not provide immediate gratification or benefit but instead prevent a greater disaster later on. In the wake of the 2008 recession, understandably Americans didn't want to hurt the economy and lose even more money than they already lost. However, considering the mounting consequences, environmental and economic, that we will.soon face, the American public needs to make the difficult decision between their pockets and the lives of the later generations.

<br><hr>
I agree completely with what Kathleen states in her comment. The movie had me skeptical if they said anything of substance and worth of my time. Like I mentioned in my last comment on the last video it amazes me how the minor minority of climate skepticisms are able to do so much damage in the media on attempting to keep their precious fuel. The movie relied on opinions and fake credibility rather than statistical facts that are worth more to me than what a person has to say. Facts speak for themselves. 
  <br><br>

Going to the point the movie attempted to make about how these measures that were put in place for climate crises were viewed badly from an economic standpoint. The world will have no more economy if we don't change our ways soon. This movie makes me very mad, so mad that people can just turn a blind eye to the suffering of countless humans and other animals and species just because some companies want to make some money for themselves.
<br><hr>
One of my biggest issues with this videos is the fact that, in the year 2012, PBS would still have the gall to give people like Lord Cornwall, Myron Ebell, a platform to speak in the first place. The inevitable association of the issue of climate change, standing in the publics mind at the crossroads of economics and science, means that any misrepresentation of climate change radically opens the issue up to negative interpretation in the mind of the public. This is why Lord Cornwall andBob Engles stand out me as such interesting figures in this documentary. They are, at their core, political figures and not scientists. But, though they are both very conservative at their core, they fundamentally share different views on climate change. Cornwall, on one hand, is stressing people to listen to science-based climate denial without offering up significant science in the first place. He is, by my own research, an opportunist and a cash-out. On the other hand, you have people like Bob Engles, who are die-hard conservatives to what I consider to be a disgusting end. But Engles sees the science of climate change not from a political or opportunist perspective, but from the perspective of someone who cares about his constituents. 

  <br><br>

What I have been shown through this documentary is that when it comes to the politicalization of climate change, nothing is off limits for what becomes political by both the most board and or narrow defintion.

<br><hr>

I too was very confused while watching this video. Being a STEM major myself it was very hard to see scientists who spent decades building a resume of credibility within their field be attacked by lawyers who are going to look at their work to try and discredit them. This is a backwards system, the scientists should be conversing among themselves and we should trust what their consensus is . They should not have to face attacks from people outside of science not for scientific, but political and in the end financial reasons. To  continue, the arguments made by some of the deniers seemed so unscientific and political it was actually funny. There was the one person who said humans caused between 0 to 100% of climate change, but could not give a certain answer, in the scientific community this would not fly.  
  <br><br>
I would also like to mention the hypocrisy of the situation. The people attacking climate change claim that the scientists are being funded by the government and should not be trusted, when they are funded by big fossil fuel companies.

<br><hr>

I felt the same confusion you bring up while watching “Climate of Doubt.” There was very clearly a severe lack of hard, undeniable evidence disproving the damage being done by climate change. One piece of evidence they tried to cite was a document signed by 31,000 “scientists” saying that they disagree with the claim of a scientific consensus that global warming is happening; the film reveals, though, that many of these people who signed the document lacked the proper training/education to give their input so confidently on such a complicated topic. These people were likely signing out of their own interests, not out of the interest of the planet. The lack of real reason to put faith in this document makes it feel like it’s just 31,000 people’s opinions, similarly to most of the evidence climate change skeptics brought up in this film. 

  <br><br>

Something pointed out to me in the film that really bothered me was the fact that climate change denialists use the same tactics as the tobacco industry to spread their information. There’s a very obvious similarity between the two: the dangers of the climate crisis are being downplayed in the same way the dangers of tobacco have been, largely due to the motivation of those who would lose profit if people realize the consequences of tobacco/climate change. It makes me incredibly frustrated that those denying climate change for the purpose of politics are really denying the rest of us the right to a clean Earth.


<br><hr>

I agree with you that while watching this film, I was just utterly confused. Before watching it, I was actually curious what anti-supporters had to say. I was anticipating hearing valid arguments, and seeing why climate change is an “issue” instead of an emergency. What I realized though was the same as you, that “Climate of Doubt” lacked any credible evidence.  Fred Singer’s graph doesn’t show the long-term temperature changes, and definitely has no weight compared to all of the data scientists have provided us over the years. Films like “Before the Flood” present real visuals, graphs, statistics etc. throughout the entire video, while this one just discredited the majority of what scientists believe—that climate change is real, here, and growing. 
  <br><br>

The political and financial motive behind spreading films like these shouldn’t be powerful enough to outweigh scientist’s presented facts. Sadly, I agree that in this generation, it is. Even though looking into this film, we’re able to witness how untrustworthy the “facts” presented are, they’re made for a reason—because they do have influence over many people.

<br><hr>
I agree that the climate skeptics’ arguments were hard to follow. I was looking out for convincing statistics or facts from the skeptic point of view that would justify their actions against the climate crisis movement, but their arguments were predominantly opinions. The only statistic provided was Fred Singer’s point that in the past decade, there was, in fact, cooling, but this was quickly disproven from climate scientists that explained that although there is a cooling trend in each decade, each individual decade was hotter than the last. The fact that Fred Singer opposed the impact of second hand smoke on people from smoking as well as the climate crisis, gave me the impression he was just looking to always want to run against the normal argument. 

  <br><br>

I like how you included the fact that these skeptics are prioritizing convenience over sustainability. I definitely feel as though the main motivation for these climate skeptics to continue their argument is to make life easier by living in ignorance. They want our representatives to keep taxes low and production high in order to keep life nice and easy. If they have to discredit the many effects abusing our natural resources has on our environment in order to keep life easy, they will. I think the main concern on the skeptics side is solely finances and has nothing to do with science, even if they try to make a scientific spin on why they are skeptical about climate change. Skeptics want to prevent paying for the necessary steps we need to take in order to limit the impending climate crisis. This can be seen when the cap and trade imposed by the Obama administration, upset many Americans, and made it so being a skeptic became a more appealing idea. 

  <br><br>

I believe it is so important that these skeptics change their mindset on the matter and remember taxes won’t matter when our Earth is no longer inhabitable.
<br><hr>

I too agree that this film was lousy overall. I also agree that it was quite confusing, it just never had a viewpoint to follow. If the goal was to prove that the climate crisis is not actually real and that it is just a hoax and sway public opinion I believe "Climate of Doubt" failed miserably. The evidence and opinions given in the film only furthered to show how silly it is that people still do not believe that this is a serious problem that needs to be fixed. 
  <br><br>

I often find that the underlying theme every week is that people do not want to make significant change because it is not yet affecting the people who are causing most of it. If there were visible affects harming the lives of people in the U.S. on a daily basis the I think that more people would stop biting their tongues and actually start to get behind the climate crisis. The major fossil fuel companies and all of the private interests that are fostering misinformation will one day have to pay for the time that they delayed the reduction of our atmospheric pollution. 
  <br><br>

I also agree with you that the graph made by Fred Singer was a very weak source of evidence to try and prove the climate change to be a hoax. The majority of scientists agree that the climate crisis is real. So, like the previous weeks its just a matter of time until people stop being selfish and start to work together to combat this issue,
<br><hr>
I also agree with you on this one. In the film, "Climate of Doubt", I didn't understand how the climate change deniers were even arguing their points. Honestly, I group climate change deniers with flat earth believers in how delusional they seem. People like this just believe what they want to believe. They don't consider how realistic it is that 98% of scientists are lying about climate change and only 2% are actually giving real facts. If it fits their agenda, then they believe it, no matter how ridiculous their argument is. 
  <br><br>

This is precisely why people got upset when Obama made actions to slow down climate change. If believing in climate change would've given them more money, then I'm positive they would bad-mouth and discredit climate change deniers the same way they do to climate change activists. The climate change issue is political, but as said before, it shouldn't be. Climate change affects all of us, and we should act against it as a planet.
<br><hr>
Although I know that the climate crisis is a very real and very prevalent problem facing the world today, I’m honestly not surprised that some people will look for any evidence they can to deny it. Most people don’t like to be told that they’re wrong, or that they’re the cause of a problem, so many of them will get defensive and deny that the problem exists. As sad as that is, the fact is that some people would rather believe that there’s no problem instead of admitting that we’ve made mistakes and that we need to fix them.
  <br><br>

Older people especially can get very upset when told that something they’ve been doing their whole lives is wrong, and I do sort of understand where they’re coming from, but denying the facts won’t change them. We know today the devastating effects that the human race has been having on the climate, and ignoring the problem is not the way to make it go away. We really need to be proactive if we want to have a chance of fixing things, but many people find it easier to just not admit that there’s a problem. I’m honestly not surprised, because it’s easier in the short term to do nothing than to do something to stop it, but once the climate crisis starts affecting them directly they may change their tune. Because you can ignore things when the consequences seem far off, but climate change does not only target the left, or the poor; no one will be unaffected.
<br><hr>

Regarding the last part of your comment, I feel like the frustrating issue of humans choosing to live conveniently rather than sustainably is one of the most difficult elements of the climate crisis to address. When it comes to taxes, I think a lot of people choose to stay uneducated on the ways that climate action will actually affect their personal lives. A present day example is the Green New Deal. Critics and climate deniers love to dismiss proposals for climate action by questioning how we will pay for it and what will happen to those whose income comes from the fossil fuel industry. This is the convenient option, which goes along with the Republican ideal of limiting change and having things stay the same as they have always been. However, deniers fail to address the fact that the Green New Deal will create millions of jobs, and likely not increase taxes enough to hit the working class too hard. But even if this weren’t the case, nothing angers me more than greedy capitalists that value their own wallets more than the fate of every living thing on the planet. “Climate of Doubt” made me think about how American culture has made every issue about money and taking sides, which will likely end up being our downfall in the future.

  It seems that this week’s assignments revolved around the thoughts and doings of climate change deniers. The film “Climate of Doubt” really goes into detail when it came to the other side of the argument, the argument which opposed the existence of the climate crisis. But what I can say I did learn from this documentary is that no matter what side you were on, there was always something sketchy going on, whether that be absurd claims, falsified data, or other slanderous tactics to prove one’s side validity more than the other’s. Though I truly believe that the climate crisis is currently happening as I’m typing, it surprised me that not only did the climate change deniers do shady things, but also the side of the climate change “alarmists”. For example, a man from the documentary stated, “If you pay scientists enough money, they’ll find what you want them to find.”, which struck me really hard. I didn’t think people would do such a thing just to prove that their side was right even if it wasn’t. At this point, it isn’t even about what we truly need to do about the situation, if there even is a situation, it’s about being on the winning (correct) side even if you’re wrong. These people are relentless and ignorant (the deniers). They can’t accept the fact that their wrong, and that they’re making things worse by making people believe they’re right. But after watching the film and the readings, I don’t even know if I’m right about anything I’m saying. For all I know, I can be on the ignorant side that believes what’s not right. 
   <br><br>
A topic I want to touch on is the political aspect of things which made me not want to believe anything that was said by the climate change deniers. It was stated in the film that the consensus is not based on science but politics, which I believe is completely true and unnecessary. No matter what the deniers said, it always seemed to tie back to either money or power. Even if what they claimed was false, it always seemed to convince the audience. It was stated in the film that, “In just four years, the number of Americans who agree global warming is man-made has dropped to about half.” The reason for this is because, “A lot of… groups were run by economists, litigators, lawyers, and public policy specialists-- people who specialized in getting a message out”, even if they were wrong. Many of the sources that believe climate change is a myth, aren’t even reliable. For example, Christopher Monckton, who is a climate change denier and former British journalist, admits that he has no scientific qualifications. Do you know how stupid you sound when you make such drastic claims without any background knowledge of the subject matter? If you’re looking for the answer, it’s stupid, really stupid, but what do I know? I’m just an average college student that has a moderate understanding in the fields of science and logic.

 I really appreciate your comment and I one hundred percent agree with your conclusions. I think the idea that  “If you pay scientists enough money, they’ll find what you want them to find.” is extremely scary but rings very true in our world today. The finically elite in the world are able to pull as many strings they want in any situation that may prove detrimental to them. I believe that everyone has a price. This can be observed in a number of public health and societal events in the past hundred years. For years, doctors were bought out so they would support the claims of tobacco companies and millions of people died due to the misinformation spread by doctors who were paid off. The question that this brings up is what will it take for people to stand on the moral side of the climate crisis and ignore the temptations of bribes or buyouts. I feel like this idea is being enforced right now and a number of real experts are actually being paid off by conglomerates to either keep their mouth shut or hide significant reports. I believe with shit does hit the fan, we all will know the truth and what we see in hindsight will be a narrative based on greed.

  If I did not have previous knowledge on the climate crisis, I would have probably believed what those people were saying- which is terrifying. In the documentary “A climate of Doubt” they throw a lot of names and associations around, but when I compared it to what I know I grew very annoyed, mainly just by their ignorance. First of all, it is extremely offensive to deny the work of scientists that have dedicated their lives to studying climate change. Then one man continues to say “… as for sea level rise, we do we know about it”- sir if you listened to the scientists we know that it is in fact rising. The same interviewee says “the Earth has been warming and cooling since day one”, but does he take into account how much more drastic it has become in the past few decades? 
  <br><br>

 Secondly, this video comes from 2012 so it made me curious as to what the non-believers views are after all the wildfires that have been spreading. In the video when someone is told 97% of scientists say it is human activity he responds “everyone is entitled to their opinion” and someone else says if they (being doubters) are incorrect he will “say sorry”. This whole video made my blood boil, but what got me the most is when one of the associations toward the end of the video said they wished they had more corporate support, but literally have one of the Koch brothers as a chairman. I googled what they own and their revenue- 110 BILLION dollars in profit and they own seven companies.

  There were two concepts that I found to be absolutely profound in the film “A Climate of Doubt”. The first being the fact that some climate change skeptics actually think that global warming is a good and necessary thing for our planet because CO2 is food for plants, and the CO2 from global warming is helping plants flourish. I do understand that plants need CO2 to survive, but we are anthropogenically producing much more CO2 than is necessary for all plants to live on earth. Let alone, forests are still burning, mostly due to human causes, and thus limiting plant life on earth anyways. The second aspect of this video that was just ridiculous was the idea that laws were being made to cut the term “sea level rise” from schools and classes in coastal communities. Sea level rise is a fact; that is like asking all math teachers to stop using the word “multiply” - they need to use these terms in order to teach things properly. As Ken mentioned in this video, each year that they sway public opinion away from the truth regarding climate change and keep us from acting on that knowledge, the more severe will be the consequences. Soon, everyone will be forced to ‘believe’ in climate change when they see it affecting their everyday lives and the people, places, and animals around them.

I share your outrage in some of the arguments that the climate change skeptics shared in the film "A Climate of Doubt." I genuinely cannot tell whether the people filmed in this documentary actually fundamentally believed that climate change was not a human caused phenomenon or whether they were just acting in a self-interested way which it seemed to be, similar to the way many politicians act in Washington. When I reflect on the film and see what these groups have done I cannot feel anything but sadness and anger toward those who have taken advantage of the public's vulnerability and lack of knowledge on certain issues like climate change and persuaded them to discount factual science that clearly shows a trend of global warming and climate change that have resulted from humans releasing unprecedented levels of CO2 into the atmosphere. Essentially, before this largescale debate about climate change and weather human impact was the cause of it (when public opinion was largely in favor of accepting climate change as a human made problem) climate change action was a bipartisan issue that could have been dealt with around 2008. Action could have been taken, and who knows where we would be now. But when the debate about whether the science behind proving climate change was anthropogenic became publicized and doubt, fear, and inaction crept into public opinion, politicians became weary of supporting taking action against climate change and even recognizing the effect that humans have had in causing it. This is what I find most disappointing. The fact that as a society and a nation we were at a point where we could have taken action but we let self-interest and smear campaigns ruin this opportunity which has led to another 9 or so years passing with little action having taken place. And here we are again, at a point where the public is beginning to realize the threat of climate change as hurricanes, fires, floods, and droughts become common news. I just hope that we can get out of our funk of inaction and have the will to change society for the better. One of the people interviewed talked about how the problem is that with the issue of climate change, people have seen it as a threat to future generations so they are unwilling to place a tax upon themselves to preserve future generations. It should not take the selfishness of the situation becoming too late to act and we are pushed to save ourselves to take action on climate change. We should be able, as a human race, to protect the earth for ourselves, our children, and our children's children. There are no excuses for inaction.

  I think I am happy to see that there are some politicians doing something for protecting the environment. Not every statesman are doing something for protecting the environment because they may have their own purpose, but there ARE SOME politicians doing real things to protect the environment. There are some people with power that are nervous about and pay attention to the climate change, which is a good sign. However, in another aspect, it seems like it needs a really long time to push a legislature or a bill forward. Meanwhile, after a long time, that legislature or bill may be pushed back. This is not a good phenomenon. Time is always the most valuable factor.

  This film was very repetitive in the sense that the two main focuses of the climate change debate thrust the same information forward the entire time. The film did not so much address the audience and did not show as much pathos: Facts and opinions were just shoved to the audience. The skeptics of climate change were shown in a derogatory light which already made any point they had to discount climate change dismissive. This film was principally shown by the view of an activist and the information presented was limited but persistent. 
  <br><br>


It was interesting to view climate change tied to the political aspect of life. Climate change is not really a political issue, it is just an issue. Climate change is affecting everyone whether democrats or liberals oppose or agree with whether it is real or not. People who opposed climate change as being man-made had no real evidence to defend their points of view. In a way, the arguments were selfish because people were purposefully denying the crisis to lower their own taxes instead of thinking of the long term benefit that could come from the Cap and Trade Act. Even people who had no scientific qualifications were spewing opinions to the crowd that the increase in carbon dioxide is actually beneficial for the environment because “carbon dioxide is plant food.” Charts and graphs point to the increase in temperature change throughout the decades and 97% of scientists support the idea that humans are the cause of the drastic changes in climate. So with the evidence presented, why are people still debating if climate change is man-made? Anthropogenic climate change is real and I think it is interesting that the opposing team to climate change is just trying to confuse the public. People don’t know who to believe and many who don't want to change their ways give in to the “evidence” given by political leaders. We need to stop debating if this is real or not and just make a drastic change and that will show the world that climate change is real

 After watching “Climate of Doubt” I realized how helpless I truly feel growing up during this time, and yes, it has always been unfair that the wealthiest of the wealthy get to control the planet but this time it’s really aggravating since its destroying our only home. It’s extremely frustrating to see organizations such as the Heartland Institute advocate so hard to confuse and ditter the uninformed American public about climate change. Along with this, the “Climategate” scandal genuinely rocked me to my core, as scientific research should be concluded through the scientific method, not just made up for cash. I feel as if there is nothing we can actually do, for as much as we fight for action for eco-friendly initiatives, it seems someone with more influence and money will push back harder. The more money the easier our representatives and politicians can be bought out. I don’t want to sound nihilistic but to be honest, I don’t see much hope until everyone is on the same side. 
  <br><br>
Moreover, this documentary made me feel especially upset for those who have not been fortunate enough to be educated on what is a legitimate source to trust, as people easily fall into believing what they are told, especially if it has some sort of stamp of approval saying it’s credible. It’s like cereal, for example Kellogg’s cereal, which is advertised to be made of whole grain so you think it’s healthy, but, if you actually read the label it has like 25 grams of sugar per serving, completely misleading. What sucks even more with this is that people are going to eat this cereal anyway because maybe they are in a rush at the store and don’t have time to look at the label, or they see the words “whole grain” and are satisfied, or maybe they just don’t care. Regardless, it’s getting consumed, happily consumed, because it tastes good and it’s cheap and easy to find. That’s exactly how climate change deniers feel about their “scientifically backed” evidence. They don’t have to change the way they live their life: how many ubers they take, how many clothes they buy from forever 21, whether they recycled that to-go cup or threw it away, whether they voted for Mr. Carbon Emissions because he wants to cut taxes. Their actions don’t matter because they are fed what they want to hear. “Whatever science makes good sense” as Bill Cook said in the documentary, it’s just easier, so deny, deny, deny. And it sucks. But you know what sucks even more? These Kellogg’s cereal eaters are eating this whole grain with 25 grams of sugar wondering why their diabetes is acting up or why they gained 10 lbs. in the last month like climate change deniers experiencing anthropogenic climate change in their areas, now suffering due to their choices. 

  <br><br>

What goes around comes around, we just have to give it more time I guess. Maybe when our neighborhoods are flooding and we start having hurricanes near the equator or something people will listen to the climate crisis.

I don't feel helpless. This documentary can make you feel powerless, like the climate deniers are winning. But it also shows that the people have control over politicians, so if we just team up, we can get legislation to help mitigate and solve the crisis. Since climate deniers deny because of economic reasons, we can find economic solutions. It doesn’t have to be the economy or the environment. It doesn’t have to be freedom or the environment. I think we just need to show them that it can be both. However, I don’t know how receptive people will be to economic and political changes, or how long that would take.

  <br><br>

I agree about money=power. It’s a little scary, to see how convincing climate change deniers can be. With money from fossil fuel companies, Heartland and Americans for Prosperity raised public support and spread misinformation. The public in turn internalized the belief and  took climate change as a social and political issue rather than a scientific issue. It reminds me of a witch hunt. Everyone is afraid to speak up because they don’t want to be killed, or voted out, like Inglis. These politicians know what they’re saying is wrong, that what they stand for is morally wrong, but they lie and avoid answering anyway. To see someone who was concerned about climate change to avoiding saying that climate change is anthropogenic by saying “It’s somewhere between 0% and 100%”. It reminds me of someone being held hostage, and they can’t communicate what they want to. Like they have to blink twice if they’re in danger. To see these politicians so afraid to speak the truth is somewhat scary. These are the people voted to power by the people, but they just say what the people want them to, even if it’s a lie about something so crucial like climate change. “Sea level rise” is a banned term in North Carolina. Scientists are targeted by American Tradition Institute. How much power do Heartland institute and other organizations have? With their clearly wrong “facts”. 
  <br><br>


This movie then shows that it isn’t the institutes: they didn’t have much power until they built their “army” by turning this issue into an issue of freedom. The economy in 2008 helped them turn this into an issue of “too much government” and “useless tax”. I should have realized this long ago, but it took this documentary to show me that it’s not that climate deniers are dumb, it’s that the information out their is so convincing. I think beliefs are strongly shaped by the society we live in. Since the climate change denial atmosphere is strong in those areas, people will cling to those beliefs and be biased against other information. There is a multitude of evidence against climate change shoved in their faces. It takes too much effort to do their own research and consider the other side, so they just accept what they believe and what seems convincing as the truth.  It’s scary to see how easy it is to silence the truth, and turn a lie into a popular belief, especially on an issue as pressing as climate change. It’s scary to see how believable it is too. I think if I was thrown into the climate change denier community before my system, I would fall prey to the lie as well. There is something very unsettling about how fossil fuel companies use their economic powers to get social and then political power. There seems to be a pattern. Companies use their money to diminish scientists’ credibility, and gain public support. With the tobacco industry and fossil fuel industry. By the time people realized the dangers of smoking, there was already a lot of casualties. Consequences of climate change are being felt now.
<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with you about the feeling of helplessness. The fact that the top 1% own such staggering amounts of wealth, even in comparison to the upper class, is unjust and corrupt. Why is it a reality that politicians can be bought with large sums of money? Why are politicians allowed to be bribed to have opinions? The poor certainly do not have the power to buy politicians, but don't they also deserve to be heard and represented? In "Climate of Doubt", I am only further angered. This is a global scale issue, this is the planet that all life inhabits. All these organizations that continue to confuse the public and raise questions about the reality of climate change are corrupt. Your statement about feeling like even if we fight against it, there will be someone richer and more powerful fighting back really resonated with me. I think a lot of the youth feel this way. We feel powerless against these big, multi-million corporations that have twisted politics in their favor. 

  <br><br>

Your cereal analogy was also very interesting! I agree, many people eat up fast information and settle for it. Information travels so fast with modern day technology that it's all taken for face value. Your statement, "it's getting consumed, happily consumed,.." is important because a lot of accepted information is similar. People are kept satisfied with the idea that climate change isn't real, and imminent danger and changes aren't in the near future. People digest this information happily because it's easier to accept it, than to start doing research and making changes to their habits and lifestyles. Why do we have to wait until dramatic damage and irreversible changes happen to change. Prevention is always easier than fixing. We can't continue to be idle and must act. Denial should no longer be an option, a notion that people in areas dramatically affected by climate change have started to realize. Our actions have consequences, and it won't be long until people start to feel these affects on a larger scale and it will have become something that cannot be ignored.
<br><hr>

I agree with you about how sad it is that the wealthiest of the wealthy are controlling our planet. Especially since they don’t have the planet in their best interest, only money. In the documentary it wasn’t surprising to me that almost everyone who believed climate change is just an over reaction was an older white male. They think this way because they don’t want people to finally realize it’s their fault that our storms are getting worse and the earth is heating up. It’s not fair that they will die soon and this earth will be a big mess that we have to clean up in order to LIVE. I don’t necessarily feel hopeless like you we’re saying, I feel motivated. Motivated to teach everyone about climate change and prove to them that it does exist and the world is heating up . (unlike what was said in the film) I feel through education and proof of scientific facts is the only way we will see change now. Let’s all be honest, a lot of Americans are lazy but if we show them the statistics maybe they will bike to the store 5 min away instead of driving. The little things help.
<br><hr>
I agree with your feeling of helplessness Claire. Watching the way that politicians have been bought out by the fossil fuel industry is appalling to say the least. This whole predicament brings me back to the Supreme Court Case Citizens United V US, a case that basically banned federal limits that PACs can make to politicians. This has allowed denial groups such as Heartland, Cato, and other CTTs to buy out American politics. I think the most frustrating part is the feeling of hopelessness, especially as a political science major who understands the workings of the US federal government. 

  <br><br>

However, the more I think about it, the more I realize that there are avenues that we as citizens can take to help fight against the misinformation that is being spread. The biggest thing I think we can do is understand US politics and get engaged. Engagement can look like voting, sending letters or calling your representatives at every level of government: local, state and federal, donate to organizations that lobby on behalf of the environment in Washington, and even running for office to change the policies ourselves. Yes money is linked to politics, and boy does it suck, but there are more ways than we think to combat this problem.

wow, love this comment. whatever goes around comes around!!! i’ve been saying that for years.. it is truly disheartening that groups like heartland are completely legal in what they are doing because of free speech in america. most people that know the facts (and the truth) would agree that it is totally immoral though

  If I could use one word to describe my overall feeling while watching "Merchants of Doubt," it would be "disgusted." A lot of the film was painful to watch as while it presented both sides of the debate, I felt as though there was this underlying aura of arrogance whenever the side of skeptics/deniers/etc. The segment of the film that ticked me off the most was the interview and surrounding details regarding Marc Marano. He blatantly  allowed a mob of people to attack the climate scientists by publicly posting and directing people to contact them via email. Even worse, he was proud that he does it and continued to act superior to, as he calls them, "greens." His overall attitude left me seething and I had to take a short break before watching the rest of the film because of it.

  <br><br>


Overall, I enjoyed the film's production. There was a style of fun and abstraction that the previous films have not captured because they were more educationally focused in their nature. At first I was a bit confused, as it started with a scene of a magician, Jamy Ian Swiss, performing a trick.  In this, they utilize the metaphor of magician magic to tell a story of misdirection and doubt when it comes to climate change. I specifically enjoyed how in some of the interviews, they transitioned from the past version of the person being interviewed to the present version. It added onto the realization of just how long this "debate" has been going on for. Also, including the deception created by the tobacco industry was a great way to represent how the public has been previously influenced by big companies in their own interest. The story of Peter Sparber and his influence on the fire marshalls was a great example of just how dangerous and hivemind-like, the issue can become.

I agree. There were a lot of parts of the film that also left me disgusted. One of the parts that quickly comes to mind is the scenes incorporated in which there are people arguing that carbon dioxide could actually be beneficial. The interview with Mar Marano was very hard to watch as well. The emails climate scientists received were truly horrifying.
  <br><br>
I too was a bit confused to why the film started with the magician, but I also did think the metaphor was a good direction. There are so many misdirections that cannot always be seen at first, but once you see the "trick" it is hard to unsee it.

 After watching "Merchants of Doubt," I am kinda heated at the situation but honestly not surprised at all. This film demonstrates just how badly our country is run by the greed of corporations that are unhealthy for our planet and own well-being. It is crazy to think that with such a large scientific consensus on climate change, the public can still be led so astray because of corporations paying off a few credible scientists (who don't even work in the field of climate science) to convince the public otherwise. It is also disheartening to see how the tactics of "Merchants of Doubt" are so widespread across many industries and lead to more harmful conclusions, such as the flame-retardant couches. 
  <br><br>
I would say we need to create a better way to make sure legislators and the public know the truth, so that lying doctors saying that they've been awarded a medal of compassion from the Dalai Lama can't make up a story about a mother putting a candle in a bed and a baby burning because the pillow was not flame retardant. But honestly, who in the world are these people? How are there people so driven by greed! I find it so appalling not only that these people exist, but they have such a major influence on our society through politics, in consequence holding down the general public's health in safety, while these companies deceive in the name of health and safety. 
  <br><br>
The though of what our political system has evolved into, like the premise of think tanks today, is also appalling. Think tanks used to be people impartially looking at science and making decisions from objective science, when now, interest groups for large corporations run think tanks and influence political policy and popular opinion in the United States. Bringing "experts" onto the media and separate sides of the argument for the sake of having a debate on TV makes it seems that both can be equally credible, when one side can have all the science and data supporting it. We need to fix this problem of communication, and I believe that the biggest challenge lies in thwarting the greedy corporation interests battling the truth so they can continue making money at the expense of everyday people like you and me, and also our planet!!

As I was scrolling through the comments, yours caught my eye, because, similarly to you, this movie also made me quite heated. It’s baffling and astonishing that in this day and age, the government and politics in general can still be so influenced by money and greed. As you mentioned, it’s disheartening to see the level of influence these big corporations have on politicians but even more so on the public, despite the consensus that already exists on climate change and its threatening consequences. An interesting point that was brought up during the movie was that, to these companies and politicians, climate change is a game they’re playing with the public. As long as they can create enough doubt, they’ve won. Even if people don’t necessarily believe climate change is completely false, their doubt will overtake their thoughts and they definitely won’t change their lifestyle. If the fossil fuel companies can convince the public and plant a single seed of doubt, they’ve won their game. 
  <br><br>
I agree with your point that legislators and the public need to know the truth. Greed and money should no longer play such a big role, or any role at all, when it comes to the government. It’s appalling that these corporations can sway politics and the health, safety and future of this planet in such a large way. This point relates to climate change and politics in that they should be two completely separate things. Politics and political parties shouldn’t affect how people form their opinions on climate change. It should be a bipartisan issue. As the movie shows, awhile back, Democrats and Republicans were once at peace on the issue of climate change, as can be seen by the Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich commercial that aired. However, since then, it has gone down hill for everyone. With the United States’ system of government, nothing can be passed without the agreement of both major parties, since the majority party in both houses of Congress and the president is rarely the same. So I think the major change that needs to happen is that people need to realize that climate change is a greater issue than political parties.
  <br><br>
As Ken mentions in his video, there is a point where people will realize that fossil fuel companies can no longer keep their practices going if we ever want to get ourselves out of this mess, and such companies will no longer be able to lie to the public, but the problem is those realizations will probably come too late. The coalition that the climate change deniers formed is quite impressive. They got everyone involved, and thought of absolutely everything.

  After watching “A Climate of Doubt”, I kind of became upset at the ignorance and lack of concern for the climate and the earth we live on. Although it is well-produced, there is so much that can be lied about and covered up in films because producers can choose which information can be displayed and shared with the public. I noticed that the majority of the so-called scientists were middle-aged and old white men that were trying to convince the audience that the climate crisis is a fluke. This one-sided demographic plays into the belief that older generations don’t necessarily believe in climate change because they were never affected by it. I also don’t like how this issue is brought into politics. It’s basically having two separate sides with one saying that we should save the earth while the other is saying that the earth isn’t in danger. However, there have been so many recent events that can’t be covered up and are literal proof of the climate crisis. It frustrates me that so many large corporations are promoting the idea that climate change is a lie so that their business(es) can succeed. They are choosing their own short-term benefit over the longevity and healthiness of the earth and all our future descendants. Promoting fake news like this, although it isn’t, should be illegal because it is giving everyone a false sense of security when in reality we should be trying our hardest to change and fix our current situation. In addition, I realized that the greenhouse effect and the fact that there are delayed effects of climate change were completely ignored. The deniers either based their information off of loopholes and how believers were lying or they also just straight up lied about/made up their information in the documentary. It disappoints me that there is such a large population that doesn’t know how much danger we are actually in and I truly hope that we can all change that and help more people become aware and as a result create meaningful change.

  When I watch “a climate of doubt”, I feel it is very interesting, because this is the first time that we could analyze the problem of climate change from the political perspective. In this film, there is a debate between two groups of people. One is the scientists who keep their opinion that the climate change is a serious problem and try their best to prevent it develop in to greater extent, and the other group of people is politicians support by big companies which are producing fossil fuel. These politicians actually serve for these companies, and they always say that climate change is not really serious to make the profit of those factories.
  <br><br>

However, as a Econ-major student, when analyze political science, I always keep and follow two principles, profit maximization and rationality. According to Popper's rationality principle, agents act in the most adequate way according to the objective situation. It is an idealized conception of human behavior which he used to drive his model of situational analysis. For the real situation of those politicians, they earn more money and support from those big companies, so they have to serve for them. From the perspective of another principle, the hidden motivation for those companies is that they desire to keep their profit at the maximum level. We can consider that if government force them to close down and produce the products that will not harm the environment. They will definitely lose money and reputation.
  <br><br>

To be honest, I am really concerned and angry about this phenomenon. I am concerned because I hope government could realize this situation and solve it as soon as possible. Climate change is not a joke. It has already alarmed us for many times in many places. People all over the world need to keep same opinion and make effort for one goal. I am angry because those politicians and companies are only considering their self-interest. As a single person, we also need to consider other people in the world, and even our next generation. The earth has already experienced many times of species extinction. Do not let human become the next one!

I agree with you entirely. As a political science major, I thoroughly appreciated the debate between the two groups of people. I agree with the scientists who believe in climate change. I am not only disappointed, but truly disgusted at our government. We are the only country in the entire world who is not signed onto the Paris Climate agreement. We have a President who thinks human-caused climate change is a hoax. We have Republicans in Congress whose campaigns are almost entirely funded by fossil fuel companies. We have a Supreme Court that allowed these corporations to have a major role in our political system in the 2010 Citizens United vs. FEC Supreme Court case. As you said, climate change is no joke. It is the single greatest threat to our country and all of mankind, present and future. We need to elect Bernie Sanders in 2020-- a candidate who supports the Green New Deal and will help lead the world in addressing the climate crisis. We need to vote out these politicians who do not believe in climate change as well as the politicians who take cautious, slow approaches. We can't wait. Our house is on fire, and we need to act. The scientists have shown we do not have much time before there will be irreparable damages made to our planet.

I like how you mentioned the notion of “profit maximization”. While I am also mad about the current situation, I realized that individuals may also be “maximizing” on a daily basis. However, instead of maximizing profit, we are maximizing our convenience and pleasure. 
  <br><br>
Should I take the bus today? No, I’m running late, I’ll take an Uber. Should I take a plastic water bottle with me today? Yea, I’m too lazy to wash my reusable one. Should I go vegan? Nah, it’s too hard. Decisions like these are so trivial compared to the decisions that politicians and company owners make, but they are nonetheless decisions that have consequences.
  <br><br>
This prompts me to think: do we really have the right to criticize big companies and governments when some of us are inherently doing the same thing, just on a smaller scale? While I know that the students taking this course are all environmentally-conscious to some degree, but if we were in the politicians’/company owners’ shoes today, how many of us will actually be 100% confident to give up success for a climate that you cannot see your personal contribution in?
<br><hr>

I think it’s really important to look at the climate issue from all different perspectives, and I really like how this comment brought in an economical studies perspective. Even though the priority of keeping our planet livable and healthy might seem so clear to me as an environmental studies major, that just isn’t the priority for a lot of politicians or working people. It’s definitely a lot easier to just see what’s right in front of you right now - like profit maximization. Like in Climate of Doubt, where the public got angry about the carbon cap-and-trade program because they didn’t want to pay more for services they were used to being at a certain price and were worried about the effect it would have on the economy.
  <br><br>

I also agree with the feeling of frustration and concern at the lack of policy and change being implemented by the government. When the scientists are clearly on one side and there’s a bunch of politicians and industry players on the other side, it seems like it should be clear which side our government should take. But unfortunately, it seems like it’s easy for these players to create doubt and confusion. It takes education and deep critical thinking to know how they’re operating and that they’re trying to spin the truth, and a lot of Americans just don’t think about politics or science that much, as they have so many other things to worry about in their day-to-day. And our politicians, while understanding politics, might not understand the science behind it. With such a complex issue like climate change, it is so easy to create confusion because people already struggle to understand it.
  <br><br>

I totally agree with the anger against self-interest. Especially by fossil fuel companies, because those are created and run by people who seem to not care about the future (or honestly the present - the effects are already occurring) at all. Hopefully, humans will take action fast enough to prevent another mass extinction.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the film, "A Climate of Doubt" is interesting to watch. Back then, there was a huge conflict between two groups: scientist and politician. Scientists believe that climate issues are significant and actions need to be taken. However, politicians ignore the truth of climate change and focus on the economy. Even though America is a democratic country which allows people to stand out and speak out their different opinions, lawmakers are still the people who lead the US and have the biggest influence. In this debate, both scientists and politicians want to gain more followers on their side, so they can lead the direction of the US to deal with the climate crisis.
  <br><br>

From the interview, it was sad that the politician ignores the scientists' works. No doubt, scientists know more science than politicians. However, politicians keep ignoring the scientists' views. It is because most politicians think money is more important. It is because the US just went through the economic collapse in 2008. The country is still in progress of recovery. Therefore, politicians need to think about the opportunity: money or climate. They think it is more important and better to use climate to exchange the money. The analogy that Bob Inglis used is that 98 doctors agree to save the kid in one way, and 2 doctors argue to save in the other way, and you want to go with those 2 doctors. It is a huge risk to the kid. A bigger risk to our home - the earth.
<br><hr>
Prior to watching both “Climate of Doubt” and “Merchants of Doubt”, I was under the impression that the political polarization of the climate crisis merely meant conservatives, republicans, and affiliates actively denied human caused climate change in an effort to continue their corporations, thus lining their pockets. I was completely ignorant of the intention to spread confusion and doubt rather than an alternative belief as well as the extent to which some of the propagators of doubt went to. This pandemic of falsified or out of context information, such as the Oregon Petition and Climate-Gate, though proven to be unfounded, created such impact as to hinder political action in favor of environmental protection.
  <br><br>

It is interesting to me to hear your perspective on this issue; as an Economics major, I have personally encountered many of your peers who are not nearly as concerned about this issue as you. Some have even adopted a similar mentality as that of the current few in power: maximization of profit by whatever means necessary. You mentioned the importance of profit maximization and rationality; is it rational to exploit the earth’s resources for short-term high profits? Is it rational to actively and knowingly create a planet that will be, as Ken says, uninhabitable or at least unwelcome by ignoring scientific facts and pursuing self-interest?
  <br><br>

However, as both the films highlighted, there is hope to change the seemingly dire political and economic squalor around climate change. Former Congressman Bob Inglis’s enlightened moment in Antarctica, seeing the ice cores that reflect the effects of the climate crisis, is a moment that many current deniers and advocates of inaction will experience in due time, though I wonder what the extent of the damage will be when they finally realize what they’ve done.

<br><hr>

I agree with you Jiao in the sense that the issue of climate change has become very politicized over the past few years and the way in which politicians go about addressing, or not addressing, the current issue at hand is pathetic, to say the least. It’s interesting that you bring up the principle of “profit maximization” because I feel that this plays such a huge role in the lack of policies and government intervention with the fossil fuel industry. We keep hearing this term “fossil fuel interest” and every time I hear how much profit and money these politicians and government officials are making off of the industry, my mouth drops as I begin to realize why nothing is being done and even why climate change is such a dicey conversation for politicians to have. For example, in the part of the documentary where the Republican politician faced major backlash and even lost his primary vote because he outwardly acknowledged the existence of climate change. 

  <br><br>

Also, Tyler brings up a good point in this thread as well. With the United States being the only country not signed onto the Paris Climate agreement and with politicians in Congress whose campaigns are almost entirely funded by fossil fuel companies, we cannot continue to put our hope into the government and wait for them to offer solutions. As professor Hiltner has advised us, it is up to our generation to start a social revolution that will pressure the government officials to listen to the outstanding evidence and the voices of the people. Much like the revolutions in the 1960s, we cannot give the government all the power in deciding our future when this is a problem that concerns the entire planet. Why are the politicians the ones who are deciding the fate of countless others? I find this to be especially disgusting when the United States is one of the main contributors to climate change, with our high CO2 emission rate and the depletion of natural resources. 

  <br><br>

It is interesting how despite the overwhelming scientific evidence and the research done by climate scientists, politicians are still not on board with the climate crisis issue. In fact, there are many who are still opposed to the idea of it! This can be seen through the Oregon Petition, which was signed by 31,000 scientists and engineers. At first glance, this petition may seem legit but in reality, it was signed by many people who have no background in climate science and it is not founded on concrete evidence that refutes the argument of climate change. This is the problem. People only see and believe what they want to, and oftentimes, it is only for their personal benefit. I then call into question whether or not humans are capable of thinking long term, as a collective population rather than the present, individual gain. It seems to me that if those in power cannot let go of their capitalist mindset, the fossil fuel industry will win every single time.

  Since I previously have watched “A Climate of Doubt,” I watched “Merchants of Doubt.”  Like “A Climate of Doubt,” “Merchants of Change” was definitely an eye opening experience.  It gives an inside look at climate change deniers, and it is quite thorough in showing just how deeply rooted everything is.  The climate deniers are simply those who have political or economic interests in things seen as harmful to not only the environment, but to its inhabitants and all things found around the world.  As such think-tanks such as the Heartland Institute are funded by big fossil fuel interests and heavily backed.  The fossil fuel interests are smart in what they do by funding these organizations who are able to provide the companies with a fresh, clean face to the public as an “expert” who denies anthropogenic climate change.  When this “expert” is used, the public will see them as a trusted source of information and therefore in their minds, it will cast doubt on what scientists are saying about anthropogenic climate change.  Then, when there is doubt in the minds of the public, it delays action as they want to be sure that something is true in order to take the proper course of action to combat it.  This tactic used by the fossil fuel interests is quite smart as it works in their favor and does exactly what they want to do.  Another factor is the fact that scientists aren’t great communicators because what they are trained to do is find the evidence and the truth.  What they don’t know how to do is properly and effectively communicate these facts to the public, creating a disconnect.  The deniers maximize upon this opportunity by using people who are great communicators and connecting with the public to sell them their ideas.  This is all bad news for our world.  Deniers are very skillful in what they do and it makes the task of combating climate change even harder as many people are swayed to doubt anthropogenic climate change.
  <br><br>

The breakdown of the climate deniers should really be analyzed by environmentalists, scientists, activists and those who want to make a difference by combating climate change.  This can be used to strike back effectively by shoring up weaknesses and gaining back the support of the public that has diminished over the years.  Now is the time to take charge of the battle and cast light on the situation to unite the public in combating climate change one action at a time.

I agree; after watching "Merchants of Doubt," it made me realize that these tobacco and fossil fuel industries utilize their own financial interests and political agenda as their main driving force. Although it was sad to watch, it was also extremely interesting to see how the tobacco companies in the beginning denied that tobacco, nicotine, and smoking had no correlation with cancer and other diseases. Once the documents were leaked that the companies knew about the detrimental health effects of their products all along, instead of denying the reports, the companies played a smart move of casting doubt on the issue instead. By casting doubt, no one really knew if the reports were true, and thus, the tobacco industry continued to earn money over time. Even worse, other companies took this as "inspiration" and thought "if tobacco companies can do this, then why can't we?" 
  <br><br>
I also agree with your point about climate change deniers. In the documentary, there were many cases shown, such as in debates, when scientists provided data of global warming, the deniers would bring data that argued the exact opposite. Additionally, when scientists release data to the public about the climate crisis, instead of being hailed as a hero, they are treated as criminals by deniers, receiving death threats and other malicious emails. 
  <br><br>
Overall, "Merchants of Doubt" illustrated that the debate of whether the climate crisis is real has nothing to do with science, but rather one of what the government should do about it. Even though factual evidence proved the clear correlation between cancer and smoking, the tobacco/nicotine industry merely casted doubt on the public, decreasing the chance of decisive government action. Unfortunately, the climate crisis currently is in the same situation.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. After I watch “Merchants of Doubt,” I’m also furious about the way all the people from the industry and scientific field denying the fact of climate change. Heat waves, sea level rises, severe droughts, and other climate disasters all need governmental intervention and regulations. Climate change can wipe out us if we do not act immediately; however, all those doubts created by coal and oil industry, government, and skepticists perplex and confuse many of the people to deny the climate change. Notably, fossil fuels companies invest money in Heartland Institute to misguide the public and spread the wrong information, which in returns, they get more economic benefits. They are tricky and smart in manipulating people’s minds. For instance, in “Climate of Doubt,” school teach climate skeptics and cut the word “sea-level rise.” Creating all the doubts, people begin to retreat and sit still. These wrong information will simply delay our decision to fight for the environmental campaign. I find these bribed officials, fossil fuel companies, and skeptical scientists selfish and absurd while they actually know the consequences that could bring to everyone’s life. They are irresponsible not only with their lives but also all the livings on the earth. 
   <br><br>

The scientists should work with professional communicators who know how to present scientific based material and evidence in a more comfortable and accessible way to the public. Climate change is happening in a way that is not reversible. I like how the film compare and contrast smoking cigarettes with climate change, but unlike smoking cigarettes have 50 years to show its impact climate change will hit us more frequently and quickly. We should act now, and there is really no time to waste. We have to learn from our past mistakes of inactions. Unite our stands and join this campaign together. It’s not a political issue; it’s a public issue, everyone’s concern.
<br><hr>

I hadn't watched A Climate of Doubt, so I watched it rather than Merchants of Doubt. Reading this, I wish I watched that one instead. It has always infuriated me how corporate media newscasters have peddled climate change deniers as equivalent to its advocates; for at least two decades, an advocate for each was shown side by side with just as much legitimacy given to both. More than that, even now-- even now!-- a climate change piece in the New York Times was recently sponsored by Shell Oil of all companies, literally having climate change fund its controlled opposition (because of course the article was not nearly as radical as it should have been). There's a thousand more examples of this, and they all make my skin crawl... 
   <br><br>

Scientists really aren't communicators, but I do think they're getting better. At least in my opinion, climate change denial is dying out. This isn't to say that climate change activists are winning in policy: nowadays, conservatives have transitioned from climate change denial to "it's not human caused" or "it's too late to stop it" or "it would be too expensive." Climate change has more-or-less been accepted as a fact, but now the opposition has simply evolved into fighting its activists on the platform of economic freedom.

</span></div><hr>


<p>
  I think that the fact that climate change is such a political issue is disturbing and unnecessary. The way that opposing parties fight over whether or not there's an actual issue is childish and ignorant. Nobody will budge from what their political party is "supposed to think." "Experts" are denying a problem and the people who deny climate change will look to these scientists to validate what they want to hear. They want to hear that it's false, so they will find these scientists who make up such a small percentage in this debate and side with them. 
   <br><br>

I think that the issue that nobody is talking about, however, is the fact that the fossil fuel industry, while destroying the earth, is offering millions of jobs in the United States alone. How are we supposed to expect a million+ people to give up their jobs, and their livelihood without an alternative solution? I come from a small town and my neighbor raises cattle. Her stance on the issue is obviously that people shouldn't give up meat and that it's not that bad for the environment. Of course, she's going to push back and she's going to take the other side because that's how she puts food on the table for her children, and how she sends them to college, how she pays for her house, etc. Yes, the world needs a new plan, we cannot keep allowing the fossil fuel industry to profit at the expense of our planet, but I think that people would be more inclined to listen if we had an alternative solution. We can all agree that we live in a very money-oriented society, and the people working in the fossil fuel industry just need a job. Yes, they make entirely too much money doing what they're doing, but they've been accustomed to the lifestyle that they've created for themselves and it's, of course, hard to give up that security so easily, especially when a lot of people won't be alive to feel the repercussions. Something needs to change or our planet will suffer as a result, but we need to work together. It can't just be us vs. them. We need to come together across party lines and offer solutions where we can still create jobs for these people who everyone is hoping will become unemployed in the very near future.

  The movie “A Climate of Doubt” mainly shed light on the hot debate about whether the human activities cause global warming. At first, when I looked at the title, I thought this film maybe talk about some reasons that cause the change in weather. I did not think this movie will focus on the influence from human activities. Because I think there is no doubt that human activities cause climate condition worse. From the movies, although I have known some skeptics’ opinion, I still believe human activities is the biggest reason leads to global warming. Like the movies say that, human will not really attach importance to the climate problem until has laws to restrict them. We always just talk “the protection of the earth, to protect the environment “and never to act. We do deforestation in order to build houses or make crafts, 
   <br><br>
Large-scale use of motor vehicles, massive burning of kerosene and natural gas and so on. All these actions lead to global warming. Normal people may do not have strength to appeal the public to change our lifestyles that causes global warming. However, every single person can start from self. I am not really like this film. Because it has main content to focus the argument and interview about deny human activities is cause of global warming. Instead, just little content to focus how to mitigate greenhouse effect.

  The movie “Climate of Doubt” was really frustrating to watch, as I strongly believe in climate change. Watching people outright deny science and convince people to the same is hard to watch. Climate change deniers skew statistics and publish false information, purposefully misleading the public. As many of these organizations and individuals get money from fossil fuel affiliates, they are simply being selfish. I was left hopeless as climate change deniers continue to make it a political issue and ignore the consequences. I agreed with Ken when he stated that climate change deniers want to create doubt in the public. This doubt halts any climate change correction and leaves people not wanting to make a change. 
    <br><br>

I thought Bob Inglis’ comparison between sick children and doctors, with climate change and skeptics was extremely well thought out. The idea that only 3% of scientists deny climate change and yet they are controlling the narrative, seems extremely ridiculous to me. As a society, we should be trusting the 97% of scientists who believe in climate change. This movie motivated me to vote for change, as well as reminded me that I should be researching who they are funded by. As a college student living in California, I do not understand those who deny science. This is not a single sided political issue, it affects everyone! We cannot be ignorant and let our children be influenced by this thinking. We must vote, protest, and voice our opinions.

You are right about how selfish those scientists, politician and institution which manipulate data and truth to protect their profit. I don’t understand why people, especially those well-educated scientists, are willing to pretend that climate change is not real when they actually understand the fact. Is money simply the answer? Don’t they ever care about the next generation or the future of the planet? 
    <br><br>
Although they may not powerful enough to burry the truth, from their perspective, simply slow down the rate of action can give them more time to withdraw their money underground. And doubt is very helpful for to do that since nobody wants to be deceived. But people don’t realize that every minute they waste for waiting or hesitating will make the consequence of climate change severer. There is also one fact we need to consider, which is that this world is in politicians’ hands, not scientists. One situation could happen, as it mentioned in the documentary that sometimes the government lose trust form the public. Besides, there are much more things other than the future of planet that the politics need to manage. Therefore, I think the practical solution will be us. Sometimes people may get fooled by institution with bad intention, but we will never lie to our best friends or family on this kind of thing. A bottom-up solution will be more solid and hard to manipulate by fossil fuel industry. Then, I believe the politicians will follow the trend.

  I find it extremely frustrating that the Heartland Institute holds annual conferences for the sole purpose of refuting anthropogenic climate change. As if it wasn't enough for them to deny the proof of global warming by themselves, they are producing doubt in the public as well and using this platform to discourage others from taking action. They utilize the Oregon Petition to establish their credibility and simultaneously discredit the research completed that supports man-made climate change. As Ken mentions in the video, it isn’t necessary for climate change deniers to even fully convince Americans that climate change isn’t real or dangerous- they merely need to create confusion and uncertainty within their minds. Even Americans who fully believe in human-caused climate change are hesitant to change their lifestyles and pass laws that will protect the environment; anyone with the slightest doubt will definitely be unwilling to contribute money for the sake of the future of our planet.

    <br><br>

Skeptics claimed that global warming could actually be beneficial to our planet by asserting how plants need carbon dioxide. Therefore, the rising emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere can’t be a bad thing, right? I think this argument is extremely naive and makes climate-change deniers seem ignorant. Even as a first-year college student, I understand that the relationship between carbon dioxide and the environment is much more complex to the point where extremely high levels of this gas in the atmosphere cannot simply be equated with more “food” for plants. I hope the American public, as well as the rest of the world, will see through the lies that are perpetuated by fossil fuel interests and be prepared to take the necessary steps towards mitigating climate change.

I agree with all of your points and I too was frustrated with the points that were brought up in the film trying to prove that climate change was not happening right before our eyes. The Heartland Institute is going above and beyond trying to instill doubt in the public regarding climate change through their book as well as these annual conferences. They are trying to justifying their stand by using what seems like credible sources like the Oregon Petition, but they don't explain what it truly is. They don't say how that the prerequisites for signing the petition weren't all that high. Not everyone that signed it had a PhD on the climate, yet the way that they explained it the casual unknowledgeable viewer would hear those statistics and take it as a reliable source. I also agree with Ken when he stated that all they were doing was creating confusion and uncertainty in their minds, and not really proving that it was not real. They talk about how carbon dioxide is good and how plants need it to survive and how we need the plants to survive for us to survive. I am also aware about the fact that we need carbon dioxide in the air for it to warm the air so that it could be habitable. However, too much of any good thing can turn into a bad thing and that is exactly the case with carbon dioxide. I am hopeful that we as a society can become more educated on this subject and not fall for the traps that those that benefit from fossil fuels, such as the Heartland Institute, set out for the public.

  After watching “climate of doubt” I was shocked to find out that companies would do anything to keep their business thriving. In the documentary they say that essentially businesses would be most hurt by any climate change legislation so fossil fuel businesses were given permission to spend as much money as possible to make people doubt climate change’s existence. I find this ridiculous and very selfish because companies would rather not have their business’s reputation hurt instead of trying to help and make steps toward tackling climate change. If this doesn’t change climate change will only get worse which will make our planet inhabitable for the next generations. Heartland Institute has framed politicians and scientists who believe in climate change as “alarmists or conspirators”. This is crazy because they are trying to justify climate change as a theory instead of something that is happening right now and we can see the effects of.

After watching this week’s film, I was also appalled at the fact that companies would do anything to keep their business thriving. This just goes to show that many people on this planet only care about themselves. They do not care about other people, other species, and the future of this planet. Ken also gave us the example in his video to imagine if “you could not use 88 out of the 100 dollars that you have.” Although this seems sad, this is NOTHING compared to how sad it would be if the next generation of people on this planet struggle to find a place to live because their hometown has been destroyed due to these terrible conditions that climate change is causing. So, I agree: I also find it very ridiculous how some companies care more about money and their reputation than trying to tackle climate change head-on. While watching this film, it frustrated me to watch these people handpick information that makes it look like climate change is not real. For example, I was furious when they tried showing “data” that showed how the earth has been “cooling” when in reality, the average global temperature has been increasing every decade.


<br><hr>
I agree that the way they were able to pick data points that were better suited for their anti-climate change narrative and ignore the overall warming trend was particularly frustrating. It is manipulation like this that adds fuel to the fire for those who deny the crisis at hand. The people responsible for this manipulation are well aware of the effects it will have on the American public. I still am surprised by the amount of educated and credentialed climate change deniers. These credentials allow their misinformation to appear more credible. Congressman Inglis' statement in his last hearing about the ninety eight doctors who agree while 2 disagree was particularly powerful because it gave the situation a real connection that in my mind seemed to hit pretty close to home even though I don't have kids.

<p>
  I think one of the most important takeaways from Climate of Doubt is the ideological divide between climate activists and climate denialists. In his interview with Tim Philips, Hockenberry asks "How does free market conservatism relate to climate change and the scientific argument over..." as Philips cuts him off to say "It doesn’t to the scientific side. It very much so relates to the policies that the left pushes in the name of global warming. Every once in a while I’ll make a statement about the science but that’s a tiny percentage of what we do and how we spend our money."

    <br><br>

This is a crucial distinction in the strategies used by climate scientists vs those employed by climate denialists. The denialists don't focus on the science, and they know that their constituents don't care about the science. They focus on the policy. They focus on the day-to-day impacts that climate policy will have on the lives of the citizenry. This is why they are so successful. At this point, after decades of extensive climate research and 97% consensus on climate change, it should be obvious that it is real and is a serious threat. But it isn't obvious. It isn't obvious because a significant portion of the American public doesn't give a damn about science. At this point, it should be clear that relying on the science does not work. People are too stupid to understand the implications of climate change on their lives in the future, or on a grand scale. But they do understand when they are told that climate action will take their jobs, raise gas prices, raise electricity prices, and limit their freedoms. So we must stop trying to hit people over the head with climate science, and instead convince them with the promise of a better future that directly involves them as individual citizens fighting for a better life.

  The film “Climate of Doubt” actually interviews scientists who support man-made crises and the skeptics. The skeptics confidently as heroes to claim that they are telling the truth and they are focusing on reality. However, on Oregon Petition that more than 31000 “American scientists” sign on paper, the skeptics cannot deny that 1/3 of them who have Ph.D. are scientists and the others are friends or celebrities. The debate over climate change issues is actually a battle between science and politics. 
    <br><br>


Also, I noticed a kidding point. A chairman who opposed to consider climate crisis once wrote down a sentence: “climate change is a problem”. Things changed after he became a chairman and he stands on the skeptic’s side. From the example, I have to doubt how many people in the skeptics do have this kind of shift? And how many of the skeptics really hold their point that climate crisis is not a problem. They don’t believe anything but money. They probably spread their propaganda in order to maintain their profits from the fossil fuel business.
    <br><br>


As long as people are misled by the debate, research and solutions to the climate crisis will not push forward and even solved. Luckily, now most people have realized that climate change is a problem and with more education and information dissemination online, more and more people can know the truth and stand together to face climate change.

Yes! I found it also very ironic that the chairman took back his once correct viewpoint and altered it in order to advance his career and make money from the side of the skeptics. It is sad that a person can have that little conviction and principle in his life. Like you said, I too wonder how many skeptics continue to vice grip their opinion in the ongoing river rapids of information that pull them towards the truth for the sake of making convenient money. I wonder if they don't grasp the understanding of just how apocalyptic the consequences of anthropogenic climate change is? 
<br><br>
Another point that really stuck out to me was one of the republican's metaphors that could more aptly be phrased: If your child is sick and 98 doctors tell you to treat him/her in this way and 2 say he/she isn't even sick, then going with the 2 doctors against the advice of the 98 is not a wise idea. That republican, Bob Inglis, showed that regarding the truth of climate change, he retained his convictions and honour at the expense of his career. Though I'm sure I won't necessarily agree with many of his other policies, I do respect him for holding his ground. I want to see hope like that in people who hold honour above the money that they could gain from sacrificing it.
<br><Hr>
I completely agree with you. The fossil companies are obsessed with the fact that there are skeptics regarding the climate crisis and they are doing their best to exaggerate the number of skeptics and the "proof" of it. Those companies are not doing it because they really believe that the climate crisis is not real, they do that just to protect their wealth.

Politicians are closely related with the fossil industry as they get paid to tell more lies about the climate crisis to the public so that the fossil industry can keep profiting. This circle of interest puts a great threat to the effort of dealing with the climate crisis as it undermines the first step of solving the problem-- acknowledging the problem. Many people still doubt the climate crisis due to this circle of interest but there are more and more people believing in the climate crisis now. As more and more people starting to acknowledge the climate crisis and taking action to mitigate it, I think the effects of the fossil companies on hiding the truth from the public will lessen and ultimately disappear.

  After watching this film, I get a better view of the opinions of those who do not believe in the theory of climate crisis. The important point that they always make is that the carbon dioxide is the food of plants which is a good thing. I wonder that why so many people believe in this kind of simple idea. This can definitely not explain as produce more food for the plants. Moreover, just as what the video said some of the experts are not actually in this area, so their voice cannot be a convincing resource for the public. Many of these people are politicians who even once changed their personal view on climate crisis after they get into positions. As a result, their voice can obviously be unconvincing. 
<br><br>
I think interest and power can be a reason why these people do all these things. It can be attributed to the desire of people. Because most of these people are in position, public can easily believe in them. I think the good lecture videos like this should be more to inform the public the truth.

  This film was very interesting to watch, as it gave a face and a voice to those that do not believe in the climate crisis. After seeing those that deny climate change, it makes me wonder why people still find their opinions valid, especially with their previous records of campaigning for industries proven to cause harm to humans such as the tobacco industry. It is truly angering and frustrating that money from these at fault corporations is all it takes for those in power to say “screw it, I’m getting paid so to hell with the environment”. This especially angers me because, well to put it bluntly, most of these people are older and won’t have to deal with the consequences of the climate crisis, so why do they get to say that it’s not real just to earn some money?
<br><br>

The part that stuck with me the most was the section with Mr. Myron Ebell. When asked what if he was wrong and simply said that he would be sorry was honestly very aggravating. My problem with that was the logic behind that train of thought. If we as a society decide to fight climate change, and somehow we were wrong and it wasn’t real, then no harm done. But if we continue to harm the planet believing that it isn’t an issue, we’re only digging ourselves into a deeper hole that we may not be able to climb out of.

  "Merchants of Doubt" did an excellent job showing how interrelated the fossil fuel industry, oil industry, and think tanks are and their effect on public policy regarding climate change. If more climate skeptics looked at the scientific facts of climate change instead of simply outright denying its existence with no evidence, climate politics would be on the other end of the spectrum instead of being as polarized as it currently is. I was shocked to learn of Marc Marano's existence and his influence on climate skepticism. He admitted to not questioning scientist's research and simple doing what he does as a climate change refuter because he enjoys it. His comment regarding death threats received by climate scientists and how he thinks they are "fun" is insensitive toward scientists and they work they do. More people need to be exposed to the interrelation big corporations have with the fossil fuel industry and its influence on incorrectly refuting climate change's existence. "Once revealed, never concealed." Bob Inglis is a leader to me for his open-mindedness. He saw the facts, thought about them, and accepted them. Unfortunately, his career was negatively impacted but he proved himself to not be a corrupt politician who is influenced by big corporations. The fact that fabrication of facts, such as the candle death case, is the fossil fuel industry's main defense says a lot about the validity of climate change and the reasoning behind climate skepticism.

As the fabrication of the candle in the crib story, the statistic that 31,000 scientists agree global warming is not due to human effects is also a lie and as you said it reveals how faulty climate change denier’s arguments are and further solidifies the fact that climate change is real because there’s no science to say otherwise. I too was appalled by Marc Marano’s behavior and arrogance. His attitude is completely unnecessary and scary because he was and is in the public eye so much that people can begin to look up to him. I wonder if deniers would actually convert if they saw the scientific data because to us, it seems obvious, but apparently, their “freedom” is more important.

  After watching the film, "Merchants of Doubt", I am completely in shock over the fact that many of these major fossil fuel industries like Koch Brothers and especially Exxon Mobile, are out here investing in people as lobbyist and deniers who specialize in fields none relevant to the climate change, such as Fred Singer, a physicist I may tell you, to spread the falsification of climate change, even with the illegitimacy of their fields of study or professions. For instance, Fred Singer and Fred Seitz were both cold war physicist (being quite anti-communist) brought to America to study the propulsion  system of Germany's V2 ballistic rockets which were capable of  long range attacks, but as the cold war ended with the collapse of the soviet union this study in ballistic missiles wasn't needed and so Singer and Seitz looked elsewhere, the Tobacco Industry. The Tobacco industry valued their own values, being against the climate activist as both Singer and Seitz viewed the climate activist as second coming of the communist (socialist in general) and which allowed them to get the funding they needed to lead the  NIPCC against the IPCC.  And somehow, as small as the NIPCC is fighting the 97% of scientist who believe that the climate change is a real phenomenon that is happening none and needs to be addressed now more than ever, they still hold a strong sway of power over the populist of the United States with groups like Americans for Prosperity, who have an estimated following of 2 million people who all share a common view of the climate change being fake. But not only is it just Singer and Seitz, but other lobbyist who are economist, political figures, and many other fields that seek there way into major establishments to spread the agenda of major tobacco and fossil fuel companies, which is downright terrible showing how badly these companies see the reality of their future creeping up on them as they try and prevent it from happening.   

<br><br>

Making matters worse is the politicization of climate change split by the liberal and conservative views, where its become a topic of battle and point of belief or deniability depending what ever side of the political spectrum you fall under. The political side of the United States is already a cutthroat divide and making it so that only one side (democrats) view climate change as an evident issue whilst the other side (Republicans) deny it, seeing it as false and viewing solutions for climate change as economic reliance. Major Tobacco and Fossil Fuel Businesses take advantage of this situation by using their lobbyist to decisively divert knowledge on the climate change through the think tanks. Example of this is at the George C. Marshall institute and Heartland Institute (the author of the recent reading we read also) who are think tanks who's main priority is to hold skeptic views of Climate Change and confront people with their "facts" on why the climate change is false. This is also intensively terrible for climate activist because of the fact that the work put out by these think tanks can advert the belief of an average person who knows nothing more about the climate change than what is written down on these bias works made to confront and pull the belief of the people into the big businesses favor. It's insane to know how much power they hold not only on people not only the people of the United States, but the government as well, where even point blank data and the census of 97% of scientist who agree that climate change is happening and happening faster than we can contemplate, doesn't even confront the government to take action. The issue that derives from this, is that the people and government that denies the work of the climate change won't believe in it until the consequences are at their doorstep, and by that point it'll be too late to fight it back. In my deeper opinion, I believe that these lobbyist and think tanks should be exploited for what they are doing on the media and other platforms so that the word gets out there and people begin to realize what is happening behind the scenes of our own "great" nation.

  I really like the awareness that this film brought. From past classes I have dipped a toe into how climate change has become a predominantly political issue. I think it was really interesting to hear about the fact climate change was a bipartisan issue until people starting opposing it because they saw economic affects to their lives. It was very strategically advertised that cap and trade would create unemployment and debt, I have never been presented with this reasoning behind Americans doubting action against climate change. One of the things that I was familiar with was the physicist, Singer, I have seen climate change deniers use his title/opinion to back up their opinion on climate change. This might be mean to say but was right does Singer have to say that climate change is a "phantom" and that it will never affect us. He obviously has nothing to worry about due to his age and shouldn't even be seen as credible if he's known for denying second hand smoke and human depletion of the ozone. I also think its pretty obvious that policy makers don't really know what they are talking about and it seems like they are willing to switch up their positions in order to keep votes. Someone that also made me really upset was Bill Cook. It literally sounded like he had no idea what he was talking about and said he believes "whatever science makes good sense", in other words, whatever science backs up what he already believes. Another phrase that is pretty triggering for me is "sound science". Someone said it in the film and whenever I hear that phrase it reminds of a video I watched about George Bush giving a speech and saying there is no sound science to climate change(I'm not sure what the video was called but it was about George Bush following a guide on what terms should are best to use in front of the public when talking about climate change, its a really frustrating video but also informative). The phrase "sound science" was created to confuse the public and to give politicians the ability to question scientific fact. Climate change should not be a debated political issue, but now that it is, it will make it 100x harder to combat the problem.

  A Climate of Doubt was very interesting to me because I did not know how the political debate started initially. It was very interesting to me how Obama's plan and Al Gore's documentary backfired and triggered the climate skeptics even more. This issue is more a fight about money and the expansion of government than climate change. It is really upsetting to see people who have no scientific knowledge on climate change persuading others and distracting from the issue at hand. It is especially upsetting when large advertising corporations are involved with tricking the public. I think this video was beneficial because it shows the other side of things and how skeptics feel. Every angle of the history matters.

  I believe that it is very smart of climate deniers to reject the consensus of various scientists who claim they believe that climate change is caused anthropogenically. This way, they can extend the time in which they are able to extract fossil fuels from the ground for as long as possible. As a result, the American public will be confused as they are slightly skeptical to the statistics regarding climate change. As a result, voters will be less inclined to support the policies that “left-wing” politicians are pushing for. Therefore, the research funded by fossil fuel companies will persist so that they will be able to reach their economic potential.

  While I was watching " A Climate of Doubt," I was literally pissed off by those deniers who says that the climate change is not caused by human activities. However, to be honest, I wasn't surprised about what they did. I can imagine that it's hard to affect some corporations with billions of dollars since they got so much [ower and high social status. For those deniers, I found that what they says are actually hollow, or lack of concrete evidence. From my point of view, they are just denying climate change is not caused by human, and then just find some superficial reasons to prove their arguments. Since I am taking course about climate crisis, I certainly know the truth is, and what the deniers says are wrong; they cannot convince me. But I believe that if the politicians still hesitate, or do nothing to stop the climate change from being worse, I am not sure who else could save the world, or save our future generation.

I literally feel the same way. It was absolutely disgusting to see these old white conservative men blatantly deny the truth. And one of the most revealing parts of Climate of Doubt for me was when the main guys trying to create confusion all had ties to the heartland institute or took money from Exxon or other fossil fuel interests! This breaks a key rule of legitimate authority, basically who is most trustworthy to get information from. The second rule of legitimate authority as I learned in my environmental ethics class is to not have a 'motive to deceive'. But they totally do! Some of the politicians were saying absolutely ridiculous things like this is a warming period and the planet and it will cool in a few years! Well guess what? 2015-2019 were the hottest on record in human history. What I learned in this documentary is that the politicians will do anything and nitpick at anything to keep their wealth and point of view. They ignored the hockey stick like graph that shows such an overall trend of intense and unprecedented warming on our planet (and remember in the DiCaprio documentary be4 the flood sent death threats to scientists who wanted to publish this) and instead picked on the variations of temperature over a ten year period! Yes of course if you pick two specific points of a ten year period (especially b/c CO2 atmosphere content is different based on the season) you can cherry pick to support your statement.

  In the video of “A Climate of Doubt and Merchants Of Doubt” and the documentary, I was impressed by the fossil fuel companies and others who sue false data such as 10 year cycle to trick the audiences. There are many evidences show that the global temperature is rising. However, those who are paid by these big company try to refuse the truth. These companies don’t want to shut down their industries that can bring them wealth, they are not satisfied by their current status. They want to own more and get more. The denial of climate crisis is not caused by human is lack of evidence, more animals in the world are going to extinct. The amount of animals in some species are declining. I can sometimes see the animals who are lack of food or lack of land to live. How can they still deny the truth when these truth are demonstrated in front of their eyes.

  The climate change, specifically referring to global warming, has long been an issue people worried about. However, after the economic downturn in 2008, many people started to be a skeptic of global warming. The skeptics were incited when Congress passed the cap-and-trade policies. These policies aimed to reduce the emission of carbon into the atmosphere, yet the policies made some people's jobs less desirable. So, the skeptics grouped together and claimed that global warming is actually a fallacy. The skeptics came up with the evidence they found to counter the scientific claim about global warming. For example, Fred Singer claimed that they did not see any warming in the last ten years in the observation. However, climate scientist Dessler said that the skeptics are just playing games with the data by deliberately selecting the observed data. I am more convinced by the climate scientists who warn a global warming trend because they showed the entire data from 1950 to 2010, and the general temperature is warming up. Another reason I do not believe the skeptics is that they are arrogant about the knowledge that they do not know about. For example, David Rouzer, a North Carolina State Senator, said he did not worry about the rising sea level because there are always global cooling and warming and we do not know about the effect of rising sea level. Skeptics like David Rouzer are not climate science specialists, but they refuse to trust the claims of the scientists. Instead, the skeptics just come up with their own claims irresponsibly.

  This whole film was so frustrating to watch because people like Myron Ebell made climate change a political issue when it was not one in the first place. The funny thing is that climate change does not even care who you are, whether you believe in it or not, whether you're a democrat or a republican, it destroys everybody in the end. "A Climate of Doubt" was literally just a film of middle-aged white men denying climate change because of their own political agenda. Those who do deny climate change believe in resources that have been fabricated and bribed. The fact that some scientists were actually paid off and bribed by fossil fuel companies and others is absolutely insane. These scientists who are supposed to be unbiased and look at directly only facts really publish and support those who are killing our planet for a bit of power and money. Greed and money is a crazy thing that makes people do crazy things. I hate that this became a political issue. Somehow, this society turns everything into a power grab move. 
<br><br>


Throughout watching the film, I honestly felt bad for those who deny climate change because they really go out of their way and hold conventions and pep rallies to promote and normalize CO2 emissions and other factors that contribute to climate change. When I heard "You call it pollution, we call it life," I literally couldn't help but laugh because it was so ridiculous. Even when teaching about climate change, the words "sea-level rise" was banned...... I have no words for that. 
<br><br>


And the most unsettling thing about this film is that this is only just a portion of those who dedicate to promoting how climate change is not due to human activity. The fact that almost all republican congressmen avoided the 3 questions asked by Davenport just shows how they think. It makes you wonder why wouldn't they answer it. This film showed me how the other side thinks and it's what I expected.

I can’t agree with you when you say climate change is not a political issue. Today, almost every problem is a political issue because there is almost always a vote on how to fix this problem. In this case, it was the cap and trade. When the economy started to go down this is what people blamed it on. So while it is ridiculous people choose to ignore climate change, it’s not ridiculous to see it from a political point of view.
<br><br>
I also couldn’t help myself from laughing when they called pollution “life,” or even worse when they called carbon dioxide “plant food.” It’s ridiculous that people have this type of mindset on carbon dioxide. They don’t see the negative effects it’s having on our Earth. Hopefully, these politicians start to gain some sense and help do what’s best for the Earth and us.

  After watching the film "Climate of Doubt" I was surprised by how strongly individuals felt against the idea of climate change but lacked scientific evidence. When republican officials were interviewed and asked about their thoughts on climate change it was easy for them to disagree it was happening but when asked for supporting evidence they either lacked proof disproving it or would give manipulated numbers that favored their argument. The clip in the movie where they show how climate deniers evidence that the earth is cooling used averages in 10 year periods which was unbelievable because when looking at the average temperatures in longer periods it is clear that the earth is warming. However, if a person was presented the climate deniers graphs showing cooling trends in the last 10 years, they would have no context of how the earth actually has been heating up. This is very problematic because people who have no background in these subjects could be easily persuaded by climate deniers since they logically can appeal to them with numbers whether they are construed or not. Now adding the fact that there are companies and interest groups spending millions of dollars to support these individuals coming up with construed numbers makes trying to communicate the urgency of climate change difficult. Not only are they funding the deniers but also are funding head officials of the republican party who reinforce these claims against climate change to there constituents. So I can understand when people of the public believe that climate change isn't happening because of these large interest groups have made a system where it's easy to feed lies to the public and for people to believe them. What I don't understand though is how these officials appointed by the people can take a check and turn a blind eye to the harm they are causing on their country they serve.

I couldn't agree more with your observations on how gullible the general public is and how manipulative the fossil fuel industry is as well. Unfortunately, the scientific data collected isn't intuitive, and a lot of bias can become involved when the data is translated into inferences and predictions. By hiring the same people who helped aid the cigarette propaganda, the fossil fuel industry with their vast amount of resources and capital have been able to manipulate the public in every way possible. As shown in the example you mentioned, it's possible to take data and graphs that support the belief in climate change, and manipulate it to help prove the opposite. The public, myself included, will take articles at face value, and won't do ay fact checking themselves. If an article or message sounds scientific enough, I have no doubt in my mind that 99% of people, if neutral on the subject, would believe it. Given this, it follows that people associated with a particular party will likely believe what their party leaders tell them. Blindly. The wealth of the fossil fuel industry, the gullibility of the public, and the association between the republican party and climate denial has led to the perfect storm.

  In my opinion, the scariest thing brought up in “A Climate of Doubt” is how easy it is to manipulate information to your favor. There are many people already don’t want to believe in climate change, so if they see evidence that supports their feelings, they are most likely going to believe it without question. This reminds me of the false link made between vaccination and autism. A British doctor with no expertise in the area made false claims that having children vaccinated might increase their chances of developing autism, and much of the world started freaking out. It was later discovered that his research had absolutely no substance and none of the information was true. But his claims were already in people’s heads, and to this day many parents are still choosing to not vaccinate their kids, which is very dangerous. A big question I had during the documentary was if deep down, climate change deniers know climate change is real and human-caused, but they deny it for financial gain, or if they are that ignorant and brainwashed. It could also be a little bit of both. So many people in our society are completely driven by money and fame, especially those in power, and solving climate change is not something that gives them either one of those things, so simply denying it is easier than trying to solve it. I think it is unjust that so many people that have power over this issue are corruptly funded by fossil fuel companies. This is similar to how most of the people that work for the FDA are either former employees of big food companies or are funded by big food companies. It is so blatantly corrupt, yet we still let it happen, and most Americans are unaware of it. It is astonishing to me that we have people making decisions for us that are so biased against our well being and are only motivated by money.

I agree that it’s scary to think how easy it is to sway someone’s belief on such a critical topic. I find it really depressing when a politician who believes in climate change lost the election because this results in the promotion of fear in Congress. I think the biggest problem lies in the monetary values that these non-believers keep holding onto. The idea of a world that is solely dependent on economy is so strongly and deeply engrained in their minds. This makes it extremely difficult to put any other perspectives in their face even with evidence that are presented. You made such a great connection between the case of vaccine and autism. I remember taking PSY 1 my freshman year, and my professor said not vaccinating your kids was like throwing darts at a room full of balloons. The balloons represented children that were susceptible to any sort of diseases, and the darts were these bacteria and viruses waiting to find their next host. But of course, there always will be some people who think autism is a result of vaccination. The only case I would agree with this situation is when the kid is allergic to eggs. You cannot convince me otherwise because I have sufficient background scientific knowledge. I firmly believe that education is also another weak spot in terms of not getting the correct information spread widely enough. I think 100% these people know climate change is happening and has a negative impact on all of us. However, they are selfish in ways they could keep the money in their own pockets because they don’t think it could affect them directly right here and right now. I feel bad for their kids and grandchildren who end up having to suffer through the consequences of these so-called “saviors of American economy.” Throughout the film, the most ridiculous line I found was this person argued that carbon dioxide is good because it’s plant food. My mind was blown. I literally said are you kidding me….


<br><Hr>

I completely agree. I think this film was so scary because it showed us who is blatantly manipulating information to the public, yet that many of these people are still very successful and wealthy. They are being supported by people they manipulated by utilizing the stress and anxieties of present (at the time) economic and social issues facing the US and generating that anxiety into anger at the prospect of the climate crisis and how it could be entirely our fault. It emphasized the old and rich white politicians that only have fame and wealth on their minds, not the future of the people they were elected to represent and protect. I thought it was really striking that many climate change deniers were showing their supporters that "the world is actually cooling"  by only showing selective bits of data from the graph that shows a clearly growing temperature trend. By manipulating the information they spout out as well as making uneducated and untrue claims like the vaccination and autism link you mentioned, people are hearing these false bits information from people and politicians they trust and look up to, so instead of doing the research themselves to make sure it's actually true before they act on it, they follow blindly and get angry, which is only making the issue worse. One part that really stuck me was toward the end when the narrator mentioned that one major issue is that many politicians and people see this as a future issue, not a present issue, and that  that is a major issue because if we don't act now, we won't have anything left to save or protect in the future.
<br><Hr>
I agree that the most alarming part of this video is how seemingly easy it has been to manipulate the information. As the video has pointed out and so did professor Hiltner, it is not that they needed to prove that scientific evidence around climate change is false but only to create doubt. Its was pointed out that this tactic is similar to what the tobacco industry was forced to do years ago. As we all know that tobacco industry is fuelled by money. Similarly, the climate change deniers like Singer, Bast, the Heartland Institute, and the Americans for Prosperity are all driven by the money they have been receiving from big corporations like Exon. I found it interesting that Exon stopped supporting them publicly after receiving much criticism. This led to anonymous funding groups like the Donors Trust. 
<br><br>

In Addition, I was unaware that to the economic depression of 2008 was a major contributor to climate change deniers, because it allowed them to stop taxes that would benefit our future generation. Bills like the Cap and Trade received such negative backlash because many Americans are against paying higher taxes that it allowed organizations like the Heartland Institute to come in and deny climate change completely. I understand that it’s hard for many Americans to pay more taxes. However, I believe climate change is going to require sacrifice for the benefit of our future generation. I agree with professor Hiltner that there is in fact a great battle going on between to the two sides. With such large corporations backing one side it seems a little scary to take on such a large fight. 
<br><br>


I am reminded of a comment that was spoken in class, one student came up to the front and mentioned that climate change should not be a political issue because it will affect everyone. This comment is so important for this week’s conversation because it seems that for many people the position they take on climate change is determined by an affiliation to a political party.

<br><Hr>
I agree with your statement that most Americans are unaware of the fact that large corporations are essentially the driving factor behind the lack of action regarding the climate crisis.  Because they are driven by immense greed, they will continue to ignore the human causes that are ravaging the Earth on a daily basis.  Our priorities in this country are skewed and are leading us closer to a lost sense of hope.  In addition, the ignorance that is evident in the way many people believe in false theories such as the illnesses from vaccinations or the falsification of climate change is absurd and quite saddening.  It is crazy to think that one person can skew a person's belief on a topic like climate change or physical health.  If there continues to be a growing number of people who continue to think this way and believe false accusations on such critical topics, it will lead to the ultimate failure of our planet.
<br><Hr>
That comment made in class really struck me too. Its something that everyone should realize, but very few people do. We are so conditioned into believing that money and status is the only important thing in life, and big corporations want it to stay that way. If everyone cared as much about climate change as they care about what outfit they are going to wear every day we probably would be much closer to solving the issue by now. In addition to realizing that climate change is not a political issue, it thinks people also need to realize that its a human issue. I think there should be more emphasis on the fact that climate change is going to kill humans, not the Earth. The Earth has already had 5 mass extinctions and this one isn't going to kill it. It will recover like it did every other time, but we will be the ones who are gone.

  Just like the reading, this film made me angry. People can be so close minded and ignorant it baffles me, and it is so deeply frustrating! The denialists are the ones who made this issue political (some people decided “sea level rise” was a left wing term), and they see themselves as rebels, but they just want to argue and ‘win.’ Climate change is not a ‘fallacy’ and yes plants turn carbon dioxide into oxygen, but we don’t have enough plants to save us (mostly because of denialists are the ones to cut our forests down). Again, everything is about money. They call climate change scientists/activists ‘alarmists’ and yet they use fear tactics in their advertisements saying that by decreasing fossil fuels taxes will increase, jobs will be destroyed, and of course Americans will lose their freedom.  
<br><br>

I also found it funny that a British guy was wearing an American flag tie while preaching to a crowd full of denialists chanting “USA! USA!” about how climate change is a hoax. I just think that if the British guy were saying the opposite, he would receive wide criticism about not being American, and thus his opinion not mattering.  
<br><br>

All of the painfully inaccurate blabber that denialists were saying was very frustrating, but I enjoyed the rebuttal that scientists made. The ‘going down the up escalator’ point was amazing, because it’s crazy how people can twist data to fit their argument. It’s not surprising that the denialists speakers received money from fossil fuels, or were lobbyists for fossil fuels. Time and time again, we see everything is about money.

I agree with your comment about how frustrating it was to watch this. It was baffling watching the rallies against global warming and how everyone was so easily influenced by scientists making their data seem one way to the public. For example, when they were “proving” that the climate change was actually decreasing, just by taking two very specific points in the graphs and making it seem that way. It truly teaches us how much effort and research we need to put in to something in order to get to the real information and knowledge we need. 
<br><br>
It was also annoying to watch how Obama used his power to bring up the issue of climate change, but in doing so, so many people wanted to oppose it just so that nothing would change. They didn’t think about the harm it could bring anybody. They just seemed very selfish and ignorant of the facts that there’s actually problems going on with our planet. It’s crazy how scientists were so convincing, they actually made it seem that the whole subject of global warming was just a hoax to the general crowd. It truly is crazy to see what people will do for money.
<br><Hr>
I think it's important for everyone to see the bigger picture, but climate denialists refuse to do so. They continue to stay in their little bubble of ignorance and 

I agree with you that it was annoying to see how Obama tried to do as much as he could, and people would oppose anything he wanted just to spite him. They certainly did not think their actions through, and they tell themselves that any law put in place to protect the planet is put there to strip them of their freedom. The 'scientists' were extremely intelligent with their marketing, but it's terrible they're on the wrong side.

  While it makes sense that fossil fuel companies don't want to lose money, it is more important that they realize that if the Earth becomes uninhabitable, how much money they do or do not make will no longer matter. Their campaign to spread misinformation about climate change is despicable. We need to prepare for the worst, even if the worst doesn't actually happen. If we work towards reversing the effects of our greenhouse gas emissions, our Earth will be all the better. IF climate change isn't real as the skeptics say, we still have a cleaner Earth. If climate change is real, well we just saved ourselves and the many other species that live here. It's a win-win situation.
<br><br>


I had a few thoughts as I watched the film, A Climate of Doubt. First, Myron Ebell's plan to get the public to doubt climate change and its effects is exactly what the reading from this week did: "highlight the uncertainties in climate science." This, in turn, increases the number of skeptics (to about 50% of polled Americans as of the film's making). Secondly, I was surprised that there were scientists that were a part of the skeptic movement. Don't they know how to analyze and interpret data? How can they not see what's going on? What didn't surprise me, however, was that they were older individuals. These people can believe whatever they want because they won't be around to see the consequences that will face future generations. The film even touched on that point, saying that many Americans don't want to pay taxes for the unborn since they themselves are not seeing the end of the world today.

  Watching the film “Climate of Doubt” made me, in short, very angry. Many of the climate change deniers expressed that they support “common sense”, but they are doing everything in their power to mislead the public. Scientific facts should not be a political issue, as it prevents important and life saving changes from taking place. Legislation in Virginia removed the term “sea level rise” from reports about coastal communities, calling it a “left-wing term”. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is nothing political about describing and predicting the changes that our planet is going through. I loved the analogy that Bob Inglis made, saying that is 98 of 100 doctors recommended a certain treatment for your sick child, it wouldn’t make sense to pick the solution recommended by the other two. But this is what climate change deniers are doing. They are ignoring common sense. They are fact picking from data and skewing it to align with their ideologies, as well as hiring scientists with corrupt histories and backgrounds, such as Fred Singer. Public opinion has a large effect on policies that are passed, and by creating doubt for the issue of climate change, it divides the common people. Even though scientists almost unanimously agree that human-caused climate change is real, the same cannot be said for the general public. And that is dangerous as it inhibits the passing of progressive legislation. I feel like our best hope for change is waiting for the new generation to take power, but unfortunately it is becoming more and more clear that waiting is the most dangerous thing we can do.

I shared the same sentiments with you when I watched this film, my watching experience was mostly filled with anger, eye-rolling, and shock. I legitimately could not believe that people deny climate change so strongly. To me, this is shocking because just by looking at the world around us, I think that we can see climate change in so many ways. From the longer summers, to the drastic weather events, evidence of climate change is all around us. I was especially angered by the misuse of scientific data to fool the public. Many climate deniers argue that the earth is currently undergoing a period of cooling. However, they took this data from a graph where the overall trend is the climate increasing. As one “alarmist” said, you can find period of downtrend in any graph if you use a small subset of the data rather than all of it. Another thing that upset me in this video was when someone was asked “What if you’re wrong?” And all he had to say was that he’d be sorry. I do not see how risking the whole earth and the future of humanity is worth denying climate change.

  In the film, it introduces the power of doubt in people’s mind. It took cigarette industries for an example to show how people can be misled by just simply casting doubt in their heads. It also showed that sometimes people are selfish enough to deny the truth and protect their own interests even they knew that their actions caused death. 
<br><br>

According to the film, cigarette companies tried to deny that their products can have harmful effects on people and they hired some companies to cast doubt about scientific consensus toward their products. The techniques they used is to let their customers to have fluke mind when they want to buy cigarettes, because sometimes people want to believe what fits their interests best, that is, if there is no solid evidence of people dying due to the cigarette, then it is safe for people to have some. I found it similar in the book “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming”, the author also wanted to argue that there is no consensus in the field of global warming and climate crisis. That made me to believe that there is another huge interest network behind it, just like the cigarette industry mentioned in that film, that controls the public opinion.

  If this film has convinced me of anything, it is that with enough money and enough power, you can convince a large portion of the population that scientific data is wrong. The anti-climate change community is heavily funded by those in the fossil fuel sector. The Koch brothers, Exxon, etc… contribute massively to the research and funding for those who oppose climate change. In their hour of need, the fossil fuel companies turned to Hill & Knowlton Inc. A PR firm best known for spreading lies that tobacco isn’t as dangerous as the research says. The fact that the same people who handled the tobacco industry’s meltdown was chosen to handle the climate crisis is evident of how dangerous those fighting climate change already perceive man made CO2. They already know that what they are doing isn’t right and instead of owning up to it and focusing on a more sustainable future, they have gone with the easiest solution they could think of. This solution was to basically just say that the scientist are not correct in saying that the global temperatures have been increasing at a rate never before recorded in human history. It would be laughable in nature if they were not already succeeding in convincing a pretty large portion of our society that work being done to combat the climate crisis is a ploy to suck money out of the good taxpayers’ pockets. It was incredibly frustrating to hear these advocates and lobbyists say, “Once we win science, we can turn public opinion”. The Idea that if they can misconstrue the data in a way that argues their point, they can convince the public that climate change is not only overhyped, but a hoax is almost commendable. I mean they decided to go after science, the thing based off of facts and data, I wouldn’t say they dug their own grave, but they didn’t make their situation any easier to go unnoticed.

  “We believe that the consensus is phony,” stated by Myron Ebell, shocked me. He, along with other important figures in America, devoted their lives to “debunking” global warming. During Obama’s term, almost all of America seemed to agree that man-made global warming is now a problem that we must face. It baffles me that individuals spend their lives trying to oppose this, even going as far as saying that scientists are only supporting global warming for financial incentives. It seems idiotic to me that Christopher Monckton, apart of the Science and Public policy institute, believes that global warming is good for the planet, providing “plant food” for our soil. If anything, it’s people like Christopher that are making these accusations for money, not the people that are climate change believers. 

<br><br>

Even though this film was made years ago, we still have plenty of people in authoritative positions, specifically the Trump administration, who take the same anti-climate change stance. I believe this is the main reason why so many United States citizens are opposed to climate change. The trickling of republican figures who disagree with climate change are increasing in numbers, making this not just an environmental issue, but also a political issue. This should not be a political issue. The facts are there, and there simply is not any real scientific evidence that proves climate change wrong. I’m not sure what else scientists and environmentalists need to do to prove that this is a real issue that is going to severely affect mankind in just a few decades.

Yes I agree that it is baffling. How can this people sleep at night? Amazing what money does to a person. I think most of these politicians already have a distorted moral compass and are semi-psycopaths (or worse) in order to climb up the ranks of the political ladder, so maybe it shouldn't come as a total surprise that they are willing to jeopardise the future of humanity for money.
<br><br>

But even more so, I think this "sick" people have actually brainwashed themselves. It seems like they convinced themselves about what is obviously false, that climate change is not real. Money acts as a sort of motivator for them to contort their mind into believing whatever it should be that they have to believe in order to make more of it. Then, being happy in the comfort that riches provide they can continue doing more of the same while ignoring all information, all science, all proof, and doubling down on their baseless beliefs. Very frustrating documentary indeed. I hope the next US president has vested interest in helping the climate.

  Climate change is a controversial topic for many Americans. There is a strong doubt by critics about anything actually changing with our planet. In regards to climate change as a political issue, I feel that our government is ignoring the scientific evidence that is in their faces about this topic. At one point, politicians such as Al Gore did act on the evidence presented in hopes of helping Americans conserve the planet. Al Gore’s solution to global warming and climate change quickly received great backlash from the public because it involved raising tax dollars. I find it a joke that Americans would rather save a few extra dollars in tax money than to help the Earth which they themselves are destroying. Money won’t mean anything when our planet is gone. Today there are groups of skeptics who’ve formed organizations against climate change and call the issue a complete hoax. Because of groups like these, politicians have pushed back on the issue. I believe that this is a hot topic because Americans do not want to take responsibility for their actions in being the cause for global temperatures rising gradually throughout the years. It feels like a direct attack on them and politicians do not wish to upset the public which then costs them their political position.

  About the content of the “A Climate of Doubt”, it shocked me that many people strongly believed climate change was just a hoax and they even stood for the evidences and statistics provided by the scientists are make-up facts. I believed that although human activities wasn’t the only reason to cause climate change or global warming, it was one of the leading reasons. It seemed convincing when they showed a graph of the temperatures automatically decreased in every 10 years as a cycle as an evidence to show how the temperatures changed by themselves instead of causing by human activities., However, that graph was so clearly at showing the rising trend of the temperature these years. How can it be an evidence to prove that climate change doesn’t exist. Also, the argument that CO2 is a "plant food" is ridiculous and CO2, which was largely produced by human activities, was the main reason to cause global warming. In addition to all these indefensible facts, the scientists who supported the hoax claim had also argued the cause of acid rain, questioned the depletion of the ozone layer and the bad and unhealthy impacts of second hand smoke, which made me curious what seemed right or worthy to believe to him.
<br><br>


In addition to these, I wasn’t surprised about what the film conveyed, since I acknowledge the whole story of the film at the very beginning of the film when it is said that fiscal or political reasons can lead to any results of the serious issues. However, I have to say, this film only made me more confused, since it only pointed out the problem that politicians and other parties or organizations were manipulating the game of the climate change without declaring the solutions or the “truths” of the hoax. Moreover, although it was effective to get a lot of useful informations from the interviews and conversations, it was a little unorganized since I sometimes wasn’t able to know which side these people were on. I  believe I wouldn’t recommend this film to my friend, since it is quite inaccurate and confusing, but I think I will discuss this issue with them and we may be can figure out a more reasonable conclusion.

After watching this film and scrolling through comments, your points resonated with me for a few reasons. Overall, I agree that this film was disorganized and confusing. While it was made clear that the filmmaker was seeking out the counterargument to the climate crisis, it was challenging to differentiate the views of the interviewees. I also think that there wasn’t a progression of events in the film, merely a random organization of the views of various climate change skeptics, without enough emphasis on the counter to those points. Even with all of these criticisms that I have, I think the filmmaker did do a good job of collecting a range of people with varying political affiliations and varying views on the climate crisis. I found it especially interesting when he spoke with Bob Inglis, who felt comfortable as an incumbent for being reelected, but was then voted out as he expressed the dire need for climate justice, going against many of the members of his party. I think that he made one of the most critical points in the entire film as he equated the number of scientists who deny climate change to 2/100 doctors telling someone what to do with a sick child.
<br><br>


I was additionally interested in your point about the graph that is used by climate change skeptics: “going down the up escalator,” as scientists describe it. This segment of the film goes to show how readily people will grab onto one piece of data, without fact-checking it, if it favors the opinion which they already hold. In my Psychology class, we are learning that people are not very likely to change their viewpoints, even with data presented to them; however, they will quickly grasp onto information that supports what they are already founded in, while ignoring any information that goes against those views. I am certain that I am guilty of this, as is everyone else in our 800 person lecture, given the fact that this is a natural, psychologically proven pattern. However, it is critical that each of us choosing to recognize these biases that we hold towards our own opinions and engage critical thinking when being presented with information before blinding believing it. We must aim to see the whole graph, rather than a small portion of it which will confirm the conclusions that we stay blindly founded in.

  "A Climate of Doubt" made me sad. Insane brainwashing just does not make sense to those truly educated on the matter, and while the movie exposes the ridiculousness of the deniers methods, it is still shocking to watch so many powerful people behave so corruptly for the sake of their success. I must admit, if you hand me an $100 bill and tell me to call the sky's color purple, I'd happily argue to have that cash in my pocket. This movie exemplifies those who deny the climate crisis are doing just that: making an entirely irrational argument for the sake of financial gain and stability. However, in this instance the metaphor would be something more like arguing, for the sake of money, that one would not die if they jumped out of an airplane with no parachute. It would seem that in such a crystal clear, life-or-death situation that the monetary sacrifice would be less than that of a human life. There is a lot more on the line than a simple denial of truth, and the fact that companies are packing in all of their corrupt plans as the clock runs out for political power to be in their favor is absolutely disgusting. 
<br><br>

It is sad to watch something so pressing and crucial to life as we know become a simple game of words. The different angles the argument can be viewed from leaves wiggle room for disproving certain aspects, and generates confusion for the public. It needs to be clarified that this topic is for the purpose of identifying a major threat to humanity, not being correct about the cause, consequences, or time frame of the issue. Why would there be this much of a debate if truly nothing was wrong?



</p><hr>


<p>
  Different from other documentaries focused on global warming, this film connects the hot-debate topic––whether global warming is mainly caused by human activities––with some political aspects. As a person who firmly believes that global warming is mainly caused by humanity, I did not expect that amount of people stands against scientific studies.
<br><br>

Although 97 percent of the scientists believe that global warming is happening and human activities is the main cause, many people still hold their own opinion. Some skeptics, who are not qualified in any scientific areas, not only distrust the data provided by scientists but stir up people’s emotions to let them stand with skeptics. For example, climate-gate and playing games with data are two “useful” ways they used again and again to overturn the “fallacy” by the climate scientists. 
<br><br>

Furthermore, deep into the political area, the irregular reactions and weird silence of the officers and the public make me confused. For example, when Barack Obama put the cap-and-trade bill on the table, instead of improving the climate condition, people afraid of losing their jobs made lots of campaign against this law. Moreover, in 2012, one government officer lost his job, just because he pointed out his perspective about global warming. In his last speech, “If your child is sick, 98 doctors give one way to cure while 2 doctors give another, I would like to believe in 98 doctors,” which is a precise metaphor of the reality. 
<br><br>

Many people eventually changed their side, due to their supporters, the fundings. They choose to entrust “2 doctors.”
<br><br>

To be honest, compared with other documentaries, “A Climate of Doubt” is less attractive to me. Because it just piled up a lot of data and interviews, without any stories. However, after watching this film, I still firmly believe that global warming indeed exists and it will get worse if we do not take action to stop it. Anyway, I believe that most people are rational about global warming and I am optimistic about the future.

I agree with you, I was very surprised to see such a community of climate deniers, I did not expect there to be as many as there were. It makes me angry to know that there is a group of people out there digging through all the scientific information to find some credible statistics that the increase in global temperatures is not due to humans. 
<br><br>

They latch onto the three percent of climate scientist that don’t believe in that climate change is necessarily human caused, while compactly ignoring the 97% that believe it is.  I agree that they find a way to toil with human emotions to get them on board with their ideas. They are so often presented with the information that supports climate change and they morph the information to help their argument, or the admittedly deny it. Sometimes I wonder if they are just denying the issue at this point to make a point, or if they have actually forced themselves to believe that climate change isn’t real. It is similar to what you stated about 98 doctors giving one way to cure to a disease and then going and listening to the other two doctors that have a different approach. Climate change denier’s pick out the information they want to hear and deny the rest. As they phrased it in the video, going down the up elevator.
<br><br>

            Something else I found interesting in the video was how many people thought that climate change was a political issue. The Cap and trade laws were an example. Citizens became up in arms due to this. It gave people a way to attack climate change. This is just another example of people being against change. They don’t want the luxurious live that they live to be harmed by anything. So in the climate crisis gets in the way of they way they live they will deny it.


<br><Hr>
I really like that you brought up the “if your child is sick, 98 doctors give one way to cure while 2 doctors give another, I would like to believe in 98 doctors” metaphor because this was probably the most memorable line of the documentary for me. It is absolutely mind-boggling to see the means by which conservative politicians and those with interests in the fossil fuel industry have gone to place doubt about climate change in the public’s mind. Making foundations with promising names, anonymous donations, and lobbying are all extremely expensive. Despite an almost unanimous consensus that anthropogenic climate change will have detrimental effects on the entire world, the voice of 2% denying scientists has a hold on a huge portion of our country. Just goes to show the hold capitalism has on this country and how viciously people will use it to advance their own agendas. 

<br><br>

     I do think that there is perhaps a reason that so many people will buy in to such a small group of scientists’ research that denies climate change. To put it simply, it’s comforting. No one wants to hear that the world is essentially ending… if there’s a group out there with some pretty damn convincing evidence that it’s not, I don’t blame people for wanting that feeling of comfort and security. The only problem here is that it’s all completely false. I too wish that somebody could come along and convince me into an ignorant bliss about the state of our planet, but sadly I’m too far worried about the climate crisis for that ever to happen.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree, it is really concerning that many politicians don't want to admit that climate change exists or that they just don't believe in it. The fact that they don't make it their first priority is disheartening, especially with Bob Inglis who decided to incorporate the concept of anthropogenic climate change in his campaign completely derailed from there. It’s extremely gut wrenching to have the government brush over this issue and many politicians continue to doubt this problem, despite the fact scientists having done extensive research presenting the amount of evidence of climate change. If we don't start taking action now, things are just going to get predominantly worse in the next couple of years.

  I really enjoyed Climate of Doubt. I also think it was smart of Ken to have us watch this after reading the climate denier book. I think I exhausted all my rage for the week on the book, so I wasn't super angry at the documentary--especially since I already knew what to expect from the deniers. Don't get me wrong, I was still angry, frustrated, disappointed, and just feeling crappy at what the deniers have been doing. The documentary also did a good job of showing how ridiculous these deniers were and that the science is the truth while not angering the deniers too much. Flat out attacking the deniers isn't a great strategy since they're very sensitive and they immediately respond to any backlash they face. So, openly attacking the deniers isn't great for the cause of mitigating the climate crisis. The documentary was smart by interviewing many deniers and attending their conferences without causing too much commotion. But then the documentary makers immediately refuted all the lies that the deniers were trying to push by interviewing real scientists. I also appreciate how they exposed all the fossil fuel money the deniers were receiving to deny climate change. All of this helped the documentary makers successfully convince their audience that the deniers were crazy without angering any hardcore deniers too much. 
<br><br>

I appreciate having to watch this documentary since I think it served as a good instructional video for how to deal with climate change deniers. Reading the first 3 chapters of the climate denial book left me with extreme anger but also a call to action. After reading, I knew I had to do something to stop climate deniers from ruining the planet via their disinformation campaign. The documentary definitely showed us how to do so.

<p>
  In Merchants of Doubt, I enjoyed the approach this film took by first analyzing the history of the tobacco industry. Most people know the science behind cigarettes and how harmful they are, but this wouldn't have been possible without the scientific evidence being publicized. By showing footage of people in the tobacco industry saying that nicotine wasn't addictive and cigarettes aren't harmful to the body is an absurd claim to hear. However, decades ago, this tactic worked. Stating that "anything in large quantities is harmful" is the scientific evidence that the deceiving industries were using. Comparing the tobacco industry--one who lied to their customers and blamed them for their unintended addictions, as well as blamed other products like furniture for igniting fires--to the climate skeptics and politicians is a very bold and accurate claim. 
<br><br>
An important point that one scientist made was that the debate was not a scientific one, it was a political one. The scientists displayed evidence over the course of the planet's existence to study the incline of CO2, creating hypotheses based off the evidence. The skeptics searched for scientific evidence to support a claim already in place, a claim that would continue to bring them an income. Even worse, those who were skeptics weren't even climate scientists! This film became frustrating at times because we were able to see the amount of power that the ignorant have. 
<br><br>
With the presentation of the correct facts to the public, I believe that significant changes will be made. There are significantly less smokers in the world because we're aware of the damages that can be done by cigarettes. Although there will be many more changes in order to purify the earth, the destruction that is occurring will worsen if ignorance continues. Once again, it comes down to Professor Hiltner's comment that power is knowledge that is acted upon.

<p>
  I cried at the end of this video because I felt robbed. Worst of all, I felt hopeless. There was hope for action and it was ripped away by a small group that built momentum through fear and fossil fuel money. This group of climate change deniers altered the course of my future and my younger brother’s future and all of the generations that are to come, and all they can say is “sorry” if it turns out they’re wrong? How will their “sorry’s” help the thousands that will suffer? I feel robbed of a better tomorrow, of a future in which I don’t have to worry about when the next fires will come, or when the next drought will be, or when the oceans will become so acidified that we will destroy nearly all of the life within them. 
<br><br>

The idea that now we still must fight these same people before we can even begin to address the issues plaguing our planet and ecosystems is devastating because if 97-98% of scientists couldn’t do it, then how can I??
<br><br>

“I rely on whatever science makes good sense.” 
<br><br>
I believe this quote defines much of the arguments made against climate action in the documentary “A Climate of Doubt”. People pick and choose what scientific data backs what they already believe to be true. You can either see the upwards trend of global warming, or you can see of the downwards trend by “going down the escalator” as they put it, picking certain points of scientific data to show cooling while there is a general warming happening on Earth. 
<br><br>
There is so much I could continue to talk about from this documentary but here were just a few other key points that stood out to me that I feel need to be brought up: the demonization of the left as pushing the environmental agenda (targeting a common enemy to many republicans rather than addressing the actual issues of climate change — and furthering the hate and division in our country), the promise of a prosperous free market coming from those who have benefitted immensely/grossly off of the fossil fuel industry and are few in numbers but will do anything to protect their wealth while the common people suffer the effects of climate change, and the fact that almost everyone interviewed in this film who was heading the climate denial movement was a white, old man. It’s terrifying how the industries and economy that caused the economic issues of the late 2000s was the same force that convinced Americans to trust the economy and that it was the government who was untruthful and untrustworthy. For a country so proud of itself, we are absolutely terrified of our government.
<br><br>

Just like the rising sea levels, the fear and deceit that wrapped its grip around the movement towards climate justice rose up and has choked the movement of its life and momentum in America, therefore choking our Earth of a clean future. 
<br><br>

Until now.

I felt a similar reaction to you when finishing this documentary. It ultimately made me lose hope for future generations to come. It angers me so much that these climate change deniers are able to bribe people to carry their same beliefs which is ultimately going to destroy our planet as we know it. We are going to continue losing our ecosystems, houses, lives, etc if people continue to believe these false promotions. What frustrated me even more was what the climate change deniers response were to be when the planet dies from climate change. Their response, and I quote would be “sorry”. This is absolutely ridiculous. Our entire plant is going to die and all they have to say is “Sorry”? While this documentary made me upset, I am really glad that we were able to watch it and see the other side of “the great battle”. The great battle, as Ken stated, is fossil fuel companies/politicians who don’t believe in climate change versus climate change activists. 
<br><br>
Climate change should ultimately NOT be a political issue, but is being made one. I knew that climate change had something to do with being a political issue, but I was never aware of the large scale. Organizations run by climate change deniers get a large amount of funding from fossil fuel companies which makes them so influential. This is also something that frustrates me a lot. One of the last points that I found interesting in this documentary was the comment regarding the metaphor of taking your child to the doctor. This comment stated that if you take your child to 98 doctors and they all say one thing, would you believe the other 2 doctors who told you something else? If those two doctors were bribing you, you might take their advice instead. This is a perfect reflection on what is happening in this documentary when they stated that 97% of scientists believe global warming is happening. That other small percentage however, is bribing people to believe their side of the story.

  As I was watching "A Climate of Doubt" I could not believe that these people legitimately thought that climate change was a myth. Honestly, I laughed when they were interviewing some of the people because their reasoning and ignorance was so outrageous. Specifically, the part that talks about the rise-in-temperature graphs; climate scientists explained that deniers would only look at certain portions of the graph and would illustrate that the Earth is experiencing a period of cooling, but this was because they were not looking at it as a whole. It was difficult to listen to non-believers who used this to support their opinion due to the fact that it is just common sense to analyze the entire trend together; it was even more difficult to see the people who agreed with them and did not point out the flaws in their reasoning. 
<br><br>


It was even more astonishing to see that a handful of scientists did not believe in the climate crisis. At the beginning of the documentary, a physicist called it a "phantom issue." Sure, this person did not specialize in the climate itself, but fundamentally scientists do not usually contradict factual evidence; maybe one or two studies here or there, but to say that this amount of evidence is false, is crazy to me. Some even went so far to sign the Oregon Petition, and while it only had about 31,000 signers of the 372 million people in America, I cannot wrap my head around the fact that people who rely on fact for their career can outright deny something with this much proof. 


<br><br>

It is so heartbreaking to see the amount of people who feel that climate change is simply false, and I have to agree with Ken when he said that all the deniers need is confusion on whether or not the climate crisis is in fact happening. If someone is unsure whether to act or not, generally they will end up doing nothing for fear of making the wrong choice, ultimately hurting our home. In the end, Dessler is correct when it comes to non-believers: "Nobody can ever say we didn't warn them."

The film, “A Climate of Doubt” introduced me to a new perspective. Though I didn’t agree with the opinions mentioned, it was interesting to see how other people interpret climate change. I understand why this was this week’s required film. To solve the problem of climate change, I think it is necessary to understand both sides regardless of personal beliefs.
<br><br>

I agree with you. I could not believe what some interviewees were saying to prove against climate change. The reasoning of the arguments was so bogus that it was amusing. You are right about your points about the rise-in-temperature graphs. Climate change deniers are trying to say that from the start of the decade to the end of the decade, the Earth was cooling. However, if you look at the rise-in-temperature over the span of 100 years, you can clearly see that the temperature is drastically going up. Another comment I found comical was when an interviewee said that global warming was good because a rise in CO2 meant more food for plants. While it is true that plants need CO2 for photosynthesis, the amount of CO2 being emitted to the atmosphere is excessive and will trigger many events along the road. It made me furious watching people talk about facts that are very clearly incorrect.
<br><br>

Because of climate change deniers, people are confused. I like what you said about people that are unsure about climate change. It is true, those that are confused will do nothing because they do not want to pick a side. There will eventually be a time when people will have no choice but to believe in climate change because of all the future catastrophes. I hope we do not have to see that day. Climate change is not a hypothesis waiting to be proven. Climate change is not an idea based on politics. Climate change is real, and it is happening now.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment that it was unbelievable to see how these people legitimately did not believe in climate change. While I was watching this I was not just upset but also kind of shocked by how confident and so quick they were to negate the facts of climate change that could easily be seen if you just look outside the window or phenomenons around the world.
<br><br>
It was also really shocking to see how many Republican politicians refused to speak on the topic of climate change and how they evaded the questions regarding the topic. Seeing how many change their views according to whose support they have or want was frustrating to see. This film was overall frustrating in this regard but it showed why these people do not believe in climate change and where they got their information.

<br><hr>

I totally agree that it was interesting to see what opinions climate change deniers had. I knew that people did not agree, but I never knew exactly what they said or how they proved their points. I did have one experience where my high school teacher disagreed with climate change. He put a graph on the board that clearly illustrated that the temperatures on earth were rising and proceeded to tell us that it was not real. Every student in the class could not believe what he had said because the figure he showed us literally showed that his opinion was false. My friends and I still joke about this time in class. 
<br><br>

Watching this film reinforced the idea that climate change deniers have no argument. Whenever they try to argue against someone who has facts on their side, their opinion comes off as amusing.
<br><hr>
I agree that it was extremely shocking to see that most Republican politicians did not want to address climate change. They came up with creative ways to dodge questions about the topic because they knew that they had no real argument for their side. It was better for them to avoid the questions rather than lose the argument against someone with real, proven facts. Unfortunately, this can earn them more voters because it illustrates that they do not believe in climate change, and others who do not support the idea of climate change will follow behind. 
<br><br>
I also agree that it was frustrating to see how politicians change their views when their voters decide something different than their actual opinion. It is even more frustrating that it does not matter whether or not they changed their opinion because it has been normalized. It should not be ok to completely change around your views according to the opinion of their voters.

  The "Merchants of Doubt" was a very sad reveal of the dirty business that controls the way that the public sees climate change. I think this video was made to help everyone realize that people are being scammed but unlike Jamy Swiss who is magician it is not good and clean tricks these are tricks that hurt the environment and give the wealthy CEO's more money. I liked the comparison of tobacco and climate change showing that any billion dollar business has similar tactics that are used to try and persuade the public's opinions. I was shocked about the flame retardants and I can not believe that that was the scapegoat used. 

<br><br>

I think it is sad that scientists who make discoveries are discredited and forced to be quiet as a result of outside hires. The creation of scapegoats and distracts such as the Oregon Petition and Climategeta which targets uniformed citizens to confuse them at the time. I am saddened by the greed of Americans and wish we would turn our interests into helping others not for personal gain. I think that this video was very eye opening and I think this should be shared to all.

  After watching the film “Merchants of Doubt” I just feel disappointed and angry again. To see tobacco companies knowingly poisoning people by selling cigarettes by designing them to be addictive and hiding that fact from the public for years. These companies knew since the 1950s that cigarettes were harmful and yet pushed the product on to the public and make them dependent on it. While consumers were not fully aware of the consequences to their (and others’) health that came with smoking, the companies that sold it to them did. And when the dangers of smoking cigarettes came to light, these tobacco companies refused to take responsibility. In an effort to reject any accountability for their literal poisoning of people, they used non-flame-retardant furniture as the scapegoat for fire-related deaths. And after many years of court, these tobacco companies were (to a certain degree) finally held accountable. 
<br><br>

    And while the effects of smoking cigarettes could be used as a proper metaphor for causing climate change in the sense you don’t (or perhaps never) feel the consequences of your actions and rather the generations that follow you will, the metaphor can only reach so far. While it took almost 50 years for people to realize that smoking was harmful and that they needed to make a change in their lifestyle habits-, as stated in the film- we don’t have 50 years to convince people that climate change is real. The planet is already feeling the consequences of climate change now, it might as evident to us living in the U.S., but to millions of people around the globe, the climate crisis has already taken its toll on them. We don’t have any more time to sit around and debate where climate change is real or not- because it is- and we need to make a change now before it’s too late. 
<br><br>

     The fact that people refuse to acknowledge the heaps of scientific proof that climate change is real because they don’t want to change their lifestyles is disappointing and ignorant. These people and their next generations will have to be worried about much more than their lifestyle habits when the consequences of the climate crisis hits them right at home.

I, too, feel your disappointment and anger. It does not surprise me that tobacco companies knowingly poisoned people because, at the end of the day, corporations only care about money and will only consider health problems to try and avoid lawsuits. I think the most shocking thing for me was that the companies blamed the increase in fires started by cigarettes that weren't put out on furniture. The fact that they preferred to blame another party instead of spending a fraction of the billions that they were making to create a self-extinguishable cigarette is horrifying. 
<br><Br>
I agree that the effects of smoking cigarettes could be used as a metaphor for causing climate change. There is a tipping point for the effects but once they do kick in (which is inevitable), they are really bad. I also agree with you that we need to act now. People would rather ignore the situation and keep living selfish lives than doing things that would curb climate change. We don't have time to convince people that climate change is real because now the effects are literally in our backyard.


<br><Hr>
After watching this, I too felt disappointed as well as discouraged. We don't have time to wait around for fossil fuel companies to come out and apologize for not telling us sooner that what they're doing is destructive. 50 years is what it took for tobacco companies to come clean, and the effects of smoking are no where near the potential consequences of climate change. What also I was extremely surprised by was how tobacco companies got around their problems, like you said with flame retardant furniture. That's exactly what fossil fuel corporations are doing by hiring "so called experts" and funding think tanks. They are blocking climate scientists from warning the public about the hazards of using fossil fuels. 
  <br><Br>
 Even with all the credible evidence that is available to the public, people want to believe the climate skeptics because it benefits their lifestyle. Kassandra I 100% agree with your statement that people continue to ignore the proof because it would hurt them in the long run. But without a changed lifestyle millions more will suffer and they will likely be our kids and future generations.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you, this film made me greatly disappointed in the overall intelligence of our country and made me lose faith in humans as a species. The anti-climate change lobbyists are forcing their opinions which are proven to be wrong on a public who is in danger of being horribly misinformed. The climate crisis is not only here, but also accelerating at a rate which will soon pass the point of no return. What I don’t understand is how this group of lobbyists argue against facts that are as equal in truth as the fact that the sky is blue. Then I realized how the main people arguing that this is not a human caused, serious issue, are those related with big oil, coal, and gas companies. Just like cigarette companies, the truth will be hidden and spun in a way that results in more business and more wealth. This selfish behavior of humans, consumerism, instant gratification, greed, all of these things are what is running the planet into the ground. Just like you stated, it took people 50 years to see through all the false information and big business’ ulterior motives to actually take action to avoid consequences. The Earth does not have this much time, it is already dying.

  The documentary "A Climate of Doubt" centers at a key discussion on whether global warming is a hoax, especially if science is being hyped on global warming. Previously I was rarely exposed to authoritative nature of the sources given by scientists regarding topics like global warming. I felt surprised to learn about the “Climate Gate” described in the video in which the scientists fabricate data in order to promote their statement. Scientists, as experts in fields, should present factual and accurate information to the public rather than exaggerate or hide the fact for their own intention. Another news that caught my attention was Bob Inglis being defeated by a Tea Party-backed candidate. It’s startled to see such a reversal in each individual’s attitude regarding the climate issue. As the documentary has suggested, the climate crisis in contemporary society is a threat not to living generations, but to future generations. The battle between fossil fuel industry, mainly merchants and politicians with funds down, and individuals who wish to mitigate climate crisis will continue. As far as I’m concerned, it’s better for people to consider the weathering issue from a future perspective rather than concentrate on their own self interest. We ought to protect our planet and that’s what can’t be substituted by the financial success some developed countries are achieving in this day and age.

  What I liked the most about the film "Merchants of Doubt" was that it investigated the tactics used by climate deniers to sway public opinion. I think its fair to say that even the most dedicated activists and knowledgeable scientists can be sort of disoriented when someone who is against them is so passionate and hostile about their position. Especially since they are supposedly representing third party interests (obviously not). I have always been intrigued by the tobacco industry and the "doubt is our product" memo as well. Tons of industries follow this model today whether it be fossil fuels, meat and dairy, pharmaceuticals, or a slew of other industries fighting to keep the public in the dark. And of course our system rewards them for this. At the end of the day I do not really think justice was served to the Tobacco industry; so they had to make a public announcement that smoking was bad and pay some hefty fines. In the grand scheme of things, nothing compared to the lives that were lost and the people who were lied to. And even today cigarettes are still on the market, still being heavily advertised in marginalized communities, and hey guess what the same moral-less people that worked for them have simply found another corporation to operate under. And in fact now industries are learning from the mistakes of the tobacco companies and using any legal leverage that they can to prevent law suits like the ones filed when it eventually came out that smoking was harmful. Does not sound like justice to me. 

  <br><Br>

I also thought the film did a great job of showing how Americans in general work against their better interests because of a ridiculous notion that anything progressive or different is "communist" and that anything that infringes on freedom is terrorism. I mean seriously, activists all over the country are fighting so hard to try to get people to change so that our future can actually be one worth living in. God forbid any money be spent to try to get people out of their cars and in public transport or biking, or to improve governmental regulations on the things that are super harmful to us. It is so frustrating to have to watch the common public be so brainwashed that they cannot even have the intellectual thought that: "oh yeah this lifestyle that I'm living will have super short term gratification but will ultimately lead to utter chaos and pandemonium in the future, maybe I should look into what changes I should make".

  <br><Br>

I think this film is a great one for getting people fired and ready to take climate change seriously. The fact that charlatans who have less credentials than me get go on TV or wherever and spew their nonsense and pretend to be as prestigious as actual scientists is laughable. I wish the film would have put greater emphasis on the fact that the changes that need to made are drastic enough to at the very least call for systematic change. Monetary gain and political power are basically the reasons why we cannot act on climate change. I say get rid of these billionaires and their puppets and lets see some on the ground action from the 99%. I know that the common person is ready for change, and tired of waiting while industries line their pockets with our future. The manipulators shown in this film were seriously fucked because this system rewards sociopaths. Change the system, change how people operate and finally get the ball rolling on climate change.

  I enjoyed watching this film because it was very eye-opening for me. I knew that politics are a big part of the climate change crisis, but I didn’t realize it was as big as it was until I watched this film. Seeing how influential and huge these organizations are that deny climate change was shocking. They get so much funding and donations from fossil fuel corporations and pro-fossil fuel organizations. Although this film is from 2012, it shows how huge these organizations (such as the Heartland Institute and Cato Institute) have gotten and how much “progress” they have made in recent years. Climate change isn’t and shouldn’t be considered a political issue in no way whatsoever. Yet, politics seem to always get in the way of this very dangerous issue. Those in the Republican party for the most part can’t even say their own beliefs regarding climate change if it doesn’t line up with the basic opinions of the Republican party. In the film one reporter stated that she asked many different Congressmen and women three simple questions regarding climate change and all of them ignored her or completely left the area she was standing in. If these Republicans talked about climate change being caused by human activities they would be voted out of office so they have to agree with their own party’s beliefs which causes a vicious cycle and impacts our earth greatly.

  <br><Br>

It was important for the film to consider both sides of the issue (both those denying climate change and supporting climate change being caused by humans) and I appreciated this aspect of the film greatly. It was interesting to hear one person being interviewed talking about climate change in disbelief and saying things that didn’t line up with my beliefs and then this completely switch to people supporting anthropogenic climate change. I was shocked by the influence these groups have on our nation and I would be super interested in knowing the update on how influential these organizations are now in 2020. Overall, this film was eye-opening and shocking in many ways. I hope that politics get less in the way of the issue of the climate crisis in the future and we stand up to educate young generations about the impact we have on our earth.

I agree with you completely that it is ridiculous how people in our government can deny climate change so blatantly when they have no evidence to back themselves up. The only sliver of evidence they had was saying that some scientists are unsure since climate science’s consensus is not complete. They would just sit there during the interview and smile, they just don’t look like they know what they are talking about. I understand though why they are looking at the past though and saying we are just continuing the trend of cooling and heating, but it is so obvious to see that our carbon footprint is nowhere near what it has been in the last century, and the rate of its growth isn’t stopping. Don’t get me wrong I do like to hear what the other side has to say, but their action has made it hard to even listen. Like Ken said, that was 8 years ago and now science is saying the climate change is real. Like you said it is sad to see them crucify one of their own just because he believes we are affecting our planet's temperature. If one person speaks out, the republicans seem to kick them out like they never were a part of that party in the first place. I agree that there is no room anymore for politics in the climate crisis because it causes people to ignore it since a large majority of the voting population don’t care and this isn’t acceptable anymore. People need to stop being so invested in fossil fuel companies and instead invest in our future generations because as of now, the lives of our future generations aren’t looking too good.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you in the fact that climate change is in no way a political issue. It is undeniably an environmental and anthropogenic issue, as Ken states, yet the majority of Republicans in office refuse to believe its existence. The facts are present all around them; however, they CHOOSE to believe it is not real because of the many corporations that fund their campaigns and salaries. Ultimately, this opinion they make known to the public creates an even further divide among political parties and a feeling of doubt among many. Sadly, I think not much will change until we see even more effects of climate change, and our generation will be the political leaders to finally take action.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the climate crisis should not be politicized. Overall this film does well in presenting the political divisions between different parties, particularly due to the climate crisis. The climate crisis is happening right now, with places all over the world being affected by it. We continue to hear about natural disasters, species declining to extinction, people having to leave their uninhabitable homes, and so on. This makes me wonder, how long will this be a political issue instead of a problem more focused on the survival of the planet? 
  <br><Br>

I also agree with your comment that we need to educate our younger generations. Just by learning about a topic and the severity of it, in this case the climate crisis, there is a result from knowing about it. Education about the climate crisis should be more emphasized and implemented in order to mitigate the problem. In being educated about the climate crisis, the younger and older generations can understand the true impacts of anthropogenic activity instead of living without any clue. If we were to think about the impact this class has on us as college students, there is hope that a generation can possess knowledge about the climate crisis and act.

  This documentary gives the viewers a deeper insight into a continuously debatable question: is there really is global warming, and if there is, is it really caused by human activities. I have to admit I didn't come out with a solid conclusion on whether the so-called global warming is a serious problem that have to be solved right now. I do believe that massive human activities had brought the earth negative effects on environment and climate. This documentary makes me ask the question that are people being hoaxed by false data by scientists or words of politicians? After all, there is only one earth and everyone should fight for its future no matter whether we would be there in the future from now on.

  In the film “A Climate of Doubt”, a debate between two groups of people is introduced. One is the scientists who believe climate changing is happening and try to stop it, the other group includes the people who are supported by huge fossil fuel companies and don’t admit the existence of climate crisis. 
  <br><Br>
After watching the film, I realize that the main factor which prevents people from protecting the environment is their interests. Although according to the research, almost 97% of active scientists agree that climate-changing is human-caused, there are still some people indicate “the global warming might actually be good for the planet”, or even deny the fact that the Earth’s temperature is rising by saying they don’t see a pattern of it in the diagrams for the last ten years, which are created to fool the audience. These so-called scientists also realize the climate crisis like others, they just don’t want to admit that, since some rich fossil fuel companies pay them money, and let them use fake data to fool and create doubt to the public, for the sake of their profits. By creating the doubts and make the public think about what is the right thing to do, the companies can use these time to extract the underground fossil fuel and use these resources to benefit themselves, like the lecture mentioned. As for the citizens in the United States, although at the beginning they have the enthusiasm for protecting the environment, after the “Cap-and-Trade” policy published with a higher tax, they started to think that they have less freedom because of this, and some of them started to agree with the skeptics’ words and think climate crisis in just a hoax created by the scientists.
  <br><Br>
People need to realize that the climate crisis is real, and it’s happening. Our environment is much more valuable than money, and we should protect the Earth no matter what it takes. Those skeptics cannot use their fake data to cover the truth, they can only fool themselves.

I agree with you that people's interests are definitely a driving force when it comes to believing in climate change or not. After watching "Climate of Doubt" I was in utter disbelief that so many people would be so ignorant and convinced that global warming is not being caused by human activity. What I found even more concerning was that a good number of the people who believe that climate change is false, happen to be elected politicians. This tells me that people are supporting these non-believers, AND they have the power to making laws, or not make laws, about this issue. 
  <br><Br>
The most upsetting thing to me is the Heartland Institute's free PDF book claiming that scientists don't all believe in the crisis. Even worse, this was targeted to K-12 teachers. The fact that institutions like this exist is frightening because their intentions are to misguide people and feed them with misinformation. Another shocking fact is that some politicians like in Montana are implementing bills so that teacher's tell students climate change is a myth. Children must be fully informed so they can work to combat the harsh and terrifying impacts of this crisis. It's also startling that fossil fuel companies fund scientists to "discredit" information. This delegitimizes many scientists because it's obvious that the issue is real and they are lying for monetary compensation. 
  <br><Br>
While this film showed a lot of people who clearly have other interests than being aware of this issue, I hope that there are even more people who take this issue seriously. It's awful that many ignorant people have political power. Hopefully my generation will be able to fight against the nonbelievers and earn new spots in politics. Overall, "Climate of Doubt" made me even more motivated to spread awareness about global warming and help inform people who don't seem to know what they're talking about when it comes to this matter.

  I wasn't surprised that many -politicians who can take action against climate change are influenced by billion dollar corporations. This is a common place for many other political issues however the difference between those and climate change is that climate change is more of a scientific issue that has been morphed into a political issue due to fossil fuel interests. Personally I found the film hilarious as it was interesting to hear the complexity (or lack there of) in the climate change-deniers arguments. As these arguments often lacked substance and a lot of the speakers there seemed to be an underlying tone of knowing climate change exists but refusing to believe in it due to the personal gain that not-believing provides them. Something very important that I gathered from the film was that Republican candidates and elected officials cannot make an effort to enact policies that curb the effects of climate change without risking political suicide. With republicans I feel like the issue of climate change and the republican party's stance on it comes from the heads of the party itself rather than from the people. By this I mean that many republicans protest climate change because that is what their parties officials believe on the matter, this goes fro both parties on a variety of issue. This problem of obeying a parties agenda without looking into issues yourself, is distance to a time where people who agreed came together to form political parties where the people had power rather than the heads of the organization.

I agree with you with the idea that the politicians who are outwardly skeptical of climate science are probably all funded by fossil fuel interest groups and are only promoting these opinions to fatten their pockets. I also had a hard time seeing the depth of the arguments they provided in favor against evidence on climate change. Many of the men interviewed provided shallow answers in response to why they did not believe in anthropogenic caused climate change. I am glad the interviewer was able to treat his guests with respect and hear them out without belittling them as people or ignoring what they had to say. This documentary is a great example of what dialogue can look like, even though most of the climate deniers did not have many intelligent things to discuss, nor the evidence to back it up. In general, this is a good film because it shows two sides of an issue, with plenty of opportunity for every argument and claim to be made. When I watch something that is so blatantly biased towards one side, it is hard for me to truly accept everything a group of people are saying as absolute or true because anything that is one-sided cannot be objective. 
  <br><Br>


Moving forward, I hope politicians and public officials of the sort can act with more autonomy to their personal views and more in line with the people they choose to represent, not just the interest groups sending them money. In the documentary someone mentioned President Barack Obama acting in accordance with what the public was thinking, in terms of climate change, and usually I would be skeptical of politicians speaking up or staying quiet in order to stay elected or garner votes, but I have changed my mind recently. This is because I know that politicians are there to serve the public (whether all of them have this goal or not) and most will adapt to what the vast majority of people want or need. Obama changed his attitude about the right for gay people to marry after, in part, he realized this was the public sentiment. If you look at a politician’s job as being a public servant, I see little wrong with passing laws and advocating for certain issues that a lot of people want, if it is right or necessary.

  I found it surprisingly difficult to watch the documentary “A Climate of Doubt”. During the documentary, I found myself not listening to what the climate change deniers were saying and even rolling my eyes a few times. I believed everything they said was completely wrong and that I was correct, after all, I am taking a climate change class. I realized that I am incredibly closed-minded when it comes to the issue of climate change. I am not alone in being closed-minded in regards to climate change. Many people on both sides of the climate change debate refuse to acknowledge the perspectives of the other side. Moreover, people on either side surround themselves with like-minded individuals and only watch media sources they agree with. This effectively reinforces previous beliefs and ultimately separates those on both sides of the debate even further. I believe that this closed-minded attitude accounts for one of the main reasons that climate change has become an incredibly polar issue in the United States.  

  <br><Br>

I was shocked to learn how apparent money is in American politics and just how intertwined fossil fuel companies are in our government. Companies in the fossil fuel industry are some of the wealthiest in the world and prioritize their financial interests over the planet and its life. These companies use their money to fund certain individuals in politics and launch different campaigns to discredit their opposers. For example, the Koch brothers have appeared In the past two films we have watched for this class and yield significant political power in the United States government. 

  <br><Br>

Finally, I found it interesting that throughout the documentary, the filmmakers kept going back and forth about who was "winning" the climate change debate during certain time periods. However, in reality, we are all losing. Climate change is winning and we will only realize it in the future.

I also found the documentary "A Climate of Doubt" difficult to watch. Everything that the climate change deniers would say would go in one ear and out the other for me. Each point they tried to make sounded rather ridiculous to me, most likely because I've been studying the climate crisis for the past few weeks. Group polarization certainly is occurring as both sides are increasingly becoming more consumed in their beliefs because they associate almost entirely with people who share their ideals. I found watching this documentary to be of value as it exposed me to people who absolutely disagree with me.While it is uncomfortable, it's important to acknowledge the perspectives of the other side so that we may better strategize a plan to get everyone on board with regard to the climate crisis.

Money has certainly become an integral part in American politics. Some of the wealthiest companies in the country are in the fossil fuel industry, and thus have a profound impact on the American economy. Fossil fuels have become the basis of the American lifestyle and economy, and it is no surprise that many politicians and citizens don't want that to end. But at the cost of the planet and future generations, it is not morally okay.

I found your last statement to be really profound. By competing for the political and moral high ground and delaying radical action, we truly are all losing the battle to the climate crisis.

  After watching this documentary, I found that people's views on climate change have been seriously affected by politics. The biggest gainers are traditional energy industries or manufacturing industries that have a huge impact on the environment. These consortiums can have a certain impact on national decision-making, and many scientists and politicians are supported by companies. This is the key reason why global warming has gradually become a political issue. No consortium is willing to bear the responsibility or pay the corresponding price for the environmental impact. So as to control the media to spread a lot of wrong information, thus disturbing people's views on climate change. There are also a large number of religious people who deny this scientific researches and think that these are God's affairs and have nothing to do with human beings. For me, after watching this documentary, I am more worried about people's attitudes towards climate change than about climate change. Although I often see many people talking about climate change, there are still too few people who really start to act.

  I really enjoyed the film “A Climate of Doubt” because of the political aspect surrounding the climate crisis and what the other side thinks of it and why they believe in skepticism so much. In political science, the one principle I always like to keep in mind when analyzing an issue is the rationality principle. This principle is basically explaining that everyone believes in something for a reason that makes sense only to them which is important in understanding why people take action in politics and are strong headed in what they believe in. The film portrays this process which is really important to understand why people are so doubtful in hopes to prevent the future generation from repeating the mistakes of the past.

The meaning of conservative is a person who preserves the values and environment of the past. Ironically, conservatives are the ones who are the biggest climate change deniers and have agendas and values that are destroying the environment rather than preserving it. The film showed that when most republicans are asked about climate change they refuse to answer and never actually give a logical explanation as to why they think nothing is changing. The quote that really sunk into me was when they were interviewing a conservative, they said “if scientists are paid, they’ll find anything you want them to find” (A Climate of Doubt). It’s really hypocritical that they say this out loud and are in this type of mindset. Republican figures in congress or lobbyists say these things without holding themselves accountable to the funding they receive from the fossil fuel industries. They are the ones who are being paid to be biased about the destruction of the environment because if they say otherwise, the funding will stop coming in and that’s not what their personal and political endgame is.

  " A Climate of Doubt" documentary did incredibly well in showing viewers how political parties such as Republicans manipulate scientific findings and utilize corrupt climate scientists to push the denial of climate change. Conventions are held by research scientists and political members who invite the middle through senior-aged white people to promote a senseless and greedy agenda communicating how human activity has had little to no effect on climate change. Over 90% of climate experts who have the education and knowledge to make sense of what is going on on our planet and are responsible for scientifically proving the increased warming temperatures on Earth are contradicted by the Republicans and 'sell-outs'.Climate scientists have more than enough reasons to become enraged and offended by knowing it alls who continue to slander their research findings. We are literally being warned by climate scientists that the climate crisis is in fact real.

Climate change largely caused by anthropogenic activities. The film underscores that around 97% of climate scientists believe in that statement. I too am shocked how many people in this film can say with such conviction that the climate crisis is a hoax. I am disappointed that instead of finding real rebuttals or accepting the reality of global warming, they would rather attack an entire profession, and their success roots in disorienting the public. From invalidating their work to stirring up controversies, I can not believe how confident they are in a refusal with no basis. I am not even that confident in my day-to-day life, let alone enough to publicly announce my disbelief in a world-wide problem with no actual scientific evidence. I was especially concerned when a man said that CO2 is a good thing. I also find it very sad that politicians/scientists/etc are basically being bullied into silence about global warming. A scientist was harassed for simply being the first quote of an article. Politicians are essentially “cancelled” if they outright support climate change. Another thing I found really interesting is the reaction to the emails because in the 2016 election, that was also the downfall of Hilary Clinton’s presidential election, which is also concerning due to four year difference.

  After watching the film, I felt so triggered by the ignorance of people who claimed climate change is a hoax by scientists that want to make money off of the issue. Seeing how people who have influence over the public constantly attack scientists that are trying to warn the people that Earth is constantly increasing in temperature makes me so angry. I really wonder why they think the way they do because they’re constantly using “facts” from here and there and not revealing some information that debunks their words. This film does a great job of showing the political figures that really believe that climate change isn’t even near and they used their power in congress to manipulate citizens who are don’t know whether climate change is real or if the government is just trying to impose a tax to get more money. I do understand the perspective of the citizens that do not know better because if they never heard anything about climate change in their life and all of a sudden, the government is stating that if you do anything to increase the carbon dioxide in the air, you have to pay a tax, it would seem really unfair and unexpected. If they knew what climate change was, I wonder if they would still be as angry as they were in the video. I think the reason why they were rallying was that they didn’t know what they were fighting for or against. This is how they were taken advantage of by political figures because they used the major’s opinion to force down any ideas of climate change in congress. For example, Obama always thought climate change was real but didn’t really state it in any of his speech because he was afraid of the public’s opinion because not a lot of people really understand climate change besides learning it from people with fame. Most people in the video with fame didn’t believe climate change is real and called people who did believe climate change was coming “stupid”. I feel bad for public figures that actually believe in climate change but can’t say it through their platform because they’re afraid of the backlash from the public. I understand how social media can bring someone down with one single event. I wish they could have a safe platform to express their concern for the environment if people who don’t believe in climate change do. I hate the fact that anti-climate changers believe they won because people in Congress won’t talk about it and I wish they would understand that the Earth is warming up at a rate that Earth has never done before.

  The film Climate of Doubt should be seen as a supplement to the reading, which is also based on the skeptics’ group Heartlands and its followers. However, the interviewer of the film, in my perception, is anti-climate change. Throughout the course, the interviewer gets in touch with climate change skeptics, including specialists, climatologists, politicians, and normal grassroots. Views of climate change activism have been included as well, but those are not the center of the topic this time. 
  <br><Br>
What I remember the most is one sentence, “ we have to win the science.” In the film, the No.1 professional contrarian Fred Singer gave one example of why global warming and climate change is a hoax. And that’s the funniest part: according to his words, and more scientifically, graphs, the Earth temperature has not gone through significant rise in the recent 10 years. Nonetheless, environmentalists “in consensus” pointed out he is simply playing with data, the trick that you can even do to intercept the interval with starting and ending points assigned the same value. Rather than calling climate change phony, misinterpreting the “going down the up escalator” graphs is even more ludicrous. Similar instances happened in the film when one leading skeptic was asked about the credibility of signers in the Oregon Petition. The embarrassment on his face relates me to some other things: has he ever read the book why scientists disagree about global warming? If so, the same awkwardness will appear on his fellows’ faces when their largest donors were dug out to be fossil fuels corporations, which situation that according to the author of the book “ is impossible”. 
  <br><Br>
Finally, I just wanna mention one thing that made me feel bad. “Ocean is winning,” said one activist scientist regarding the debate of whether the sea level will rise dramatically in the next few decades. This word reminded me of something. Is there any potential benefit for us humans if one side in the debate is proven right or wrong? We are just thinking about getting public opinion or control the policies, whereas the environmental progress is irreversible. Therefore, I eagerly hope the day that let “the ocean” to decide our fates will never come...

I also recognized the embarrassment on the leading septics face when asked about the credibility of the Oregon Petition and I too felt that that same face would appear if people recognized that the article we read was sponsored largely by fossil fuel organizations. What I have been having a hard time understanding is why the American public trusts political and media figures on scientific issues mores than scientists who devote their lives to studying the issues they present data on. Isolating a 10 year span was said to show a decrease in temperature, but if one were to look at a span of 100 years they would recognize that climate has indeed been increasing in temperature while it cools for a period every 10 years. The fact that these skeptics are allowed to deliver their ideas to children within K-12 education due to the uncertainties they had about the climate warming  is appalling and is shocking to me that these ideas are beating factual science. This makes me sad, that American people are only listening to singular viewpoints on the climate issue and are continuing to allow fossil fuel companies to brainwash their minds making them believe scientists are part of a political stint. As a viewer of this documentary I could understand how these skeptics could be convincing but still, hearing the data and hearing the science that supports the climate change activists is more convincing to me than propaganda "exposing" these scientists. These skeptics used the touchy idea of taxes as a way to campaign to the American people that climate change was not real and that believing in such an idea would lead to more government and tax increase. By using this subject they reached a large quantity of Americans and largely changed how Americans handled the urgent issue. 
  <br><Br>

After watching this video I realized that an extremely large effort needs to be made by both scientists and political figures in order to create a change within the American viewpoints. The political figures seems to have more influence over scientific issues than actual scientists, a climate skeptic actually states that he has no scientific background at all and is technically not qualified within the field he speaks of, but yet...he is a likable public figure. The American public needs to learn to trust scientists who are not out to get them and get their money, but want to save their future offspring and the planet on which they live. Until Americans believe in these scientists they are doomed by the neglecting viewpoints of the political figures they prefer to trust on issues they want to "win" not "scientifically prove through data".

  I’m not sure how it is possible that the same lobbyists and so-called experts that supported the tobacco industry are still able to be recognized as valid sources in any form. It seems like the only thing that these people have proven is that they are very good at what they do. It’s disappointing that credible climate scientists are being drowned out simply because they lack the PR expertise that the fossil fuel companies have essentially purchased. If all it takes to implode a socio-political movement like the one that had bipartisan support in the mid-late 2000s is a boatload of money and a strong PR campaign then the fight back to consensus among voters seems at first glance like an uphill and perhaps unwinnable battle. 

  <br><Br>

At the same time, the massive swing of public and political positioning also shows that many people’s opinions regarding climate change are subject to change once again. In that sense, I believe that energy on this portion of the issue is best spent considering how we can convince people of the already existing science. The most obvious solution is education. Combating climate challengers in the classroom (especially knowing that they’ve tried to reach the same place with the text we read this week) is the best possible way we can ensure this debate doesn’t continue into the distant future. In the more immediate term, it is essential that people advocate for politicians who will fight for appropriate responses to climate change. 

  <br><Br>

A more intricate solution to this issue would be campaign finance reform. The non-profit think-tanks forming and perpetuating these arguments are largely funded by the same people and companies who are putting climate challengers into public office. If effective campaign finance reform were enacted (likely beginning with a re-examination of Citizens United), not only would I predict a return to bipartisan support for “green” legislation, but constituents on both sides of the aisle would be assured that their voices are the loudest ones in our government’s ear.

I was frankly surprised, although I definitely shouldn't have been, when I heard that many of the people running the anti-climate change PR campaign were the same ones that came from the tobacco industry.  It of course makes sense, throughout the 20th century the tobacco industry spent how many millions of dollars on advertising trying to convince people against the indisputable science that smoking causes cancer and other awful diseases.  Their intent was not to fully convince people that smoking was not harmful, but at least sow enough doubt in their minds that they would be inactive in changing and continue to buy tobacco products.

  <br><Br>

The parallel between that 20th century tobacco campaign and the current climate skepticism one are obvious.  Much like the cancer cigarettes cause to the individual, climate change is a cancer to our entire world.  But our economy is "hooked" on fossil fuels with seemingly no easy way to transition off them.  So all it takes is for these huge fossil fuel corporations to make the American people question the validity of widely accepted science, in doing so remaining inactive and putting off the issues of climate change for future generations.  Like you said, in our current system of campaign finance it is all too easy for these multi-billion dollar companies to spend ridiculous amounts of money, essentially buying skepticism for science that should be settled and accepted.  I think the first step to educating American skeptics about climate change is to educate them on where their false information comes from, and on who is benefiting directly from their confusion.  Because when climate change does hit, and hit hard, it won't be the billionaires who are the most effected but the average voters they managed to convince that nothing is wrong.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree with your points as you brought up everything I had been thinking. When the film was discussing how Fred Singer, one of the main climate change deniers featured, also rejected the harmfulness of secondhand smoking, all I could think was ‘This man is a clown how is he being taken seriously by anyone?’ The main voices in their movement were all so unreliable as they were being supported financially from fossil fuel industries. The power that the fossil fuel industry holds is undeniable as they are able to reach into the pockets of politicians and scientists, therefore holding great influence over environmental policy and can have an “expert” back their narrative. They are also able to broadcast their message through massive advertisement campaigns that unfortunately do reach lots of Americans who are easily absorbed by them. The propaganda campaigns by the organizations mentioned in the film made me think of the parallels between them and organizations like the NRA who has huge political power and has garnered lots of support through their campaigns. It frustrates me because they can have so much influence simply due to the sheer wealth they have. The climate crisis is not being highlighted enough and sustainable energy is not being utilized due to the lack of funding and money backing it. The power the fossil fuel industry has is due to the money they have and that’s how they stay in power. 
   <br><Br>
To me, the biggest takeaway is the influence money has in the climate debate. There should be no debate over climate change but due to the money that the fossil fuel industry has, they continue to influence policy and education and control a piece of the climate change narrative by raising doubt amongst the American public. Capitalism plays a direct role in the continuation of climate change as the money is in the hands of fossil fuel, and corrupt politicians who can enact change are benefiting from that money. We need to be able to have people in government who are not puppets of the fossil fuel industry, who will actually start subsidizing renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. We need the money backing the fossil fuel industry to start backing renewable energy. Finding billionaire investors who will put their money into that is rare and will not be enough, we need a change in government and that starts again with the people and voting.

<br><Hr>

It astounds me that scientists like Fred Singer are still believed by the public. He has shown to be wrong in every case he has argued for, and he will be shown to be wrong about climate change. I will say I liked the way the interviewer in this film asked questions. He seemed very objective and accepting of climate deniers while asking questions that quietly showed their greedy intents. One question comes to mind: "What if you're wrong?". When asked this, Myron Ebell said he would be sorry. The right answer would be that we all die from a radically different and inhabitable climate. I believe Ebell knows this, but does not care, since public opinion on climate change is already going in the right direction. Fossil fuel companies and climate deniers (paid or not) know they are fighting a war which they will eventually lose. All they want to do is slow down the climate change movement enough to extract as much oil and natural gas out of the ground before it becomes too expensive to do so. They are not worried about a changing climate, because they know the opposition will not let the problem become big enough to cause catastrophe to individual Americans. As soon as Americans start dying directly as a result of climate change is when public opinion will start swaying back to support of environmentally conscious policies and decisions. I believe we are at this point now. However, we must look to the importance of economy in this debate. A weak economy lets skeptics fear-monger and spread doubt. We must remind the skeptic public that switching to renewable sources of power will not completely destroy the economy as fossil fuel companies say. We must also remind them that a carbon tax is not a ploy by the government to make more money. It is difficult for poor people to care how an intangible environment is doing when their biggest issue is scraping together next month's rent.

  The film A Climate of Doubt emphasizes the impact of politics on public opinion and vice versa. Global warming seemed to be generally accepted due to the convincing facts in Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth in 2006 and the 2007 report that global warming is occurring and is probably human-caused, but since then skeptics have been increasingly vocal. The struggling economy of 2008 gave the skeptics an opportunity to push back on climate change and cap and trade by inciting fear in the public that these efforts would slow the economy further and cause the loss of jobs. This allowed skeptics to find their place in the House of Representatives, which is very concerning because of their ability to prevent bills meant to combat climate change from being passed. 
  <br><Br>
The filmmakers are effective in highlighting that skeptics are highly politically and financially motivated. Those pushing back against taking action on climate change are backed by big business, fossil fuel industries. For example, the Heartland Society in Chicago is funded by Exxon. It is very frustrating that the skeptics are so easily manipulating the public with very little true evidence behind them. They make it look like the data shows cooling trends by not showing the full graph that clearly portrays an upward trend in temperatures; 31,000 American “scientists” counter the scientific consensus, even though even Fred Singer admits that most of them have little knowledge on climate science; “Climate-gate” emails are enough to generate suspicion in the climate change data even after the emails are determined to be inaccurate. The climate crisis is only becoming increasingly intertwined with politics, and with our current administration, skepticism is constantly pushed onto the public. The GOP refuses to answer simple questions about climate change and when Republican congressman Bob Inglis became vocal about accepting the scientific consensus, he faced the Tea Party Rebellion. 
  <br><Br>
During the film, John Hockenberry poses the question that if a 97% scientific consensus is not enough to convince skeptics that climate change is real and is caused by human activity, will anything ever be enough. Clearly, so far, the answer to that question is no because the money that fossil fuel industries have gives them enough power to influence politics and push skepticism forward. If we ever want things to change, then the public must stop supporting these industries and take away their power, but that does not seem very realistic at this point in time.

The climate of doubt discusses how corrupt individuals spread misinformation propaganda information. I was especially surprised that such a large group of "scientists" thought climate change wasn't a real thing. Until I realized all it took to qualify was a bachelor's degree. Also, the scientists selected weren't well versed in the climate crisis; in fact, most had never studied it.  
  <br><Br>

I was surprised about the email requests and how invasive the climate deniers were beeing taking after the climate gate. They were going to use something in the emails to embarrass some of the climate scientists. FOA requests are an exciting part of what climate activists have to deal with.

I think it's a terrible flaw that members of congress don't want to answer questions about global warming. The republicans seem just to dodge the question.

  "A Climate of Doubt" is a well-done feature, but it did make me extremely angry about the politicization of an indisputable environmental concern. To see these "conventions", full of white, middle-aged/old men promoting false science and skewed graphs was incredibly concerning. At the end of the documentary, it is revealed that a lot of these "scientists" are funded by fossil fuel companies trying to corrupt scientific opinion and government policy, and it blows me away to see that this information exists and is readily available and shows that these studies are false, but people still rely on these debunked arguments to stall the climate change movement. I don't quite understand why people refuse to see the corrupt arguments when the evidence is right there, but I'm assuming the spread of misinformation and the effect it has on congress members has something to do with the public's resistance to the truth. Also, I noticed that any notion of the greenhouse effect as being an integral part of CO2 release was completely ignored by the climate deniers argument.  

  <br><Br>

The whole email scandal threw me for a loop as well. Because this video was eight years ago, I was only 10 when it was made, and had no idea of the "climategate" ordeal. But now, after having seen the effects of the email scandal on Hillary Clinton's campaign, I felt like I had deja vu. Both scandals were gripped tightly by conservatives and played a big role in trying to bash the left's arguments, whether it was for climate change or presidential candidates. The focus on them baffles me personally, but it did make me laugh seeing the ATI reach out to every climate scientist, asking for their emails as well, hoping to find a shred of information to skew in order to discredit the studies. I don't really understand how they could perpetuate an organization like that, hellbent on finding ANYTHING that sounds suspicious, and still think they are in the right. 
  <br><Br>


It was strange to see how many other issues were pulled into the climate debate as well. Not only politics, but religion and the economy were also questioned. It's weird because I don't really understand how religious views would impact the credibility of scientists and the term "godless left" doesn't make sense to me either. I find that a very strange attack, meant to demonize the left for what, wanting to preserve the Earth? Even if they don't believe in the giant consequences of human action, wouldn't it still be nice to help the planet? I don't know, the whole debate about seems very trivial to me, but it seems that humankind is up against money-hungry fossil fuel corporations.

I was also upset at the entire situation by the end of the film. I was partially aware of the corruptness occurring, but this opened my eyes to it on a new level. As you pointed out, the conventions are full of white, middle age men. This is very representative of the government as a whole. This feature was made 8 years ago now, and not much has changed. People taking money to knowingly lie to everyone is disheartening to see and makes me question what I can and can not believe without doing extensive research on the topic first. The feature also really shows how powerful the fossil fuel corporations are. They make such an absurd amount of money that it is no wonder why they want to push their climate change denial agenda. It is completely unethical, but makes sense from a business standpoint. I am not sure if it is actually illegal to pay scientists to claim certain things (seems like it should be) that deny anthropogenic climate change, but that any well educated person would do such a thing to potentially harm literally everyone and things on this earth is completely unethical and selfish.
  <br><Br>

I believe the climate crisis should not be a political issue, but obviously it has been made into one. By turning a lot of the right wing into climate change deniers, the fossil fuel corporations have succeeded in the advancement of their agenda and made it harder for them to be stopped. The climate does not care about political parties and will continue to rise despite the political situation unless something is done soon. Unfortunately, a lot of the climate crisis lies in politicians hands and they are ultimately the ones who can actually make an impactful difference.

  What I felt most when watching "A Climate of Doubt" was frustration. Frustration over how people can jeopardize the future of the planet, over our political system and the vice grip lobbying money has on it, and over how seemingly little in our country has changed societally since the film was made in 2012. I was struck by how politically polarized the nation was back then and continues to be now. There is definitely a great divide in America at the moment between the heartland and the coast as well as the young versus the old. Unfortunately this divide politicizes issues that shouldn't be political issues, but human issues (such as climate change). The earth isn't going to have mercy on you whether you support climate change or not. I found it amazing that people continue to listen to that idiot Lord Monckton even after he said he had ZERO scientific background. He and other professional contrarians realized they can make a living by preying on people who aren't educated on facts and can present them misinformation in a "ra ra" style that gets them politically motivated. Another thing that pissed me off was how consistently throughout the film, skeptics used the term "global warming" instead of climate change. It is no coincidence that all of the climate scientists that believe in climate change used the term "climate change" while skeptics used "global warming". Skeptics can use the lens of global warming to cherry pick stats to show that the earth is not warming, when in fact warming does not capture the whole issue of climate change. In a sense they are conflating weather with climate when they are not the same thing. What skeptics don't realize is that climate change doesn't just entail warming, in fact in some places it may not get warmer at all. Climate change means, well, the climate will change. This means extreme weather (cold and hot), drought, sea level rise, species extinction, and a host of other issues. Shame on leading skeptics for spreading their misinformation to people who don't know any better in the name of lobbying money and political power.

I completely agree. It was incredibly alarming to watch these skeptics completely deny the 97% consensus on climate change, as these skeptics are the ones in power and if they cannot agree with 97% consensus, then it almost feels like there is no hope. It was incredibly frustrating to hear the skeptics say that in order to change their ideas of “global warming” and if it is real or not, they need scientific data and need to be persuaded by the public. This is ridiculous!!! Outside of these politicians and big businesses who thrive off of fossil fuels financially, everybody else is greatly affected by climate change, and in full support that there is real scientific data that cannot be denied and that our planet is in great danger. The Oregon Petition made me feel incredibly upset as well, because only a third of the signees had a Ph.D., while a handful of them were people with no scientific background or just a friend/relative. It bewilders me that these skeptics can be so confident in their words when they have absolutely no validity and nothing to back up what they are saying. It makes me even more upset to hear them say that if their opinions turn out to be wrong regarding climate change, then all they can say is “sorry”. Sorry, but to all the politicians and fossil fuel industries out there, an apology will not save my generation, my kids generation, or the generations beyond. This is ignorant, repulsive, and overall just really disgusting to hear.

I found it incredible to watch these individuals spew statements with a clear desire to spread misinformation. Considering the clips at the end of the documentary, we were shown a key issue with our democracy – while political leaders initially supported the facts, as companies and lobbying groups began to support lies, Americans began to dissent. This lead to the politicians needing to fall to the will of the people to get reelected, rather than attempt to create long-term structural change. By focusing on investment and fighting misinformation campaigns, political leaders could have enacted real change towards stabilizing our democracy to the effects of lobbying. I was left asking what we could realistically do to combat this massive misinformation campaign, and I came to the conclusion that a massive reeducation campaign would be necessary. I wonder if it would be possible to advertise on the terms of the facts to help reduce dissent and spread accurate information.
<br><hr>
I strongly agree with your stance on the film “A Climate of Doubt”. These people that consider themselves rebels for going against the climate change movement make it difficult to fully understand their point of view. One thing that I noticed was that during the “annual pilgrimage for the key skeptics” the majority of the audience were older people, specifically men. This protrays excalty what the issue is: the older generation doesn’t consider climate change a real problem because they lived their lifes already without experincing hardcore climate disasters as today. This is a scary fact because the older generation has been in power for so long that it is hard for any policies defending the environment, to get passed and executed. Another thing that I agree with what you said was that it is frustrating to hear these skepticals say that the earth has not been warming up for a certain period of time and thus global warming isn’t real. For example, Christopher Monckton stated, “Warming isn’t, in fact, accelerating. In fact, there's been none for 15 years”. There is a clear distinguish between global warming and climate change. These skeptics depend heavily on the word “global warming” to defend their position on how the world is fine, however the crisis is on climate change. Climate change causes extinction of species, drastic climate events, ocean acidification, and shrinking ice sheets, etc. However I never once saw this group address these issues. The reason for not fully attacking the problem is due to their hunger and greed for money and status. Furthermore, it is hard to believe a group of people who state a claim on a controversial topic when they haven’t had any experience with science or climate. Christopher Monckton, for example, really had the audacity to rally people up by saying that global warming is “bull-” when he has no scientific qualifications. He is one of those people that believe scientists are phony and are being paid by the government to alter data to “make” climate change a real problem. This makes me think, what if it is the other way around? Powerful climate doubters could’ve paid scientist to prove that climate change isn’t real.
<br><hr>
 I too fell great frustration during my viewing of “A Climate of Doubt.” It was surprising to learn how much of an impact these politicians had on generating skepticism in public perception on the climate crisis. I agree that little change has been done throughout the past 8 years and it is safe to say that the division is deeper in politics since the Trump Administration. I remember years ago when I used to hear people talk and worry about “global warming” and climate change, but I also came to the realization that people stopped talking about it years ago. I am shocked to realize that I unconsciously followed the public when it came to the topic and awareness of climate change. This documentary and my experience reveals the power of politics on the public and the influences of the media. Once the politicians who were against climate change gained grounds and popularity, the media grasped onto their philosophies and broadcasted them everywhere. I found it disturbing that because of the desire for profits, media companies would air blatant lies on television that denied the existence of climate change without any evidence. These advertisements were made to instill skepticism by spreading conspiracies to create fear and doubt such as “the government is using climate change to restrict your freedom.” 

<br><br>
 I was also super frustrated when the people were all listening to “Lord Monckton” who has no idea what he is talking about. The fact that he is able to gather all these people in a politically in a movement against climate change when he has no scientific background is both humorous and appalling. What I did not find surprising was the fact that his followers mainly consists of older generations. At no point in this documentary did I see any representation from my generation which frustrated me even more. The old generation vs. the new generation is definitely a factor in the lack of action. In Congress and in movements such as Heartland and the American Family Association, the older generation is in power. This makes it harder for the newer generation to enact any policies or come together to change public opinion. 

<br><br>

 When I learned that fossil fuel companies were funding most of the politicians and organizations that were against climate change I immediately discredited everything that they stood for. It seemed ridiculous that people would still believe in the words these old people say when it is public knowledge that fossil fuel companies are funding them. Fossil fuel companies lose out the most when policies are enacted to place a tax on them. I also found it cowardice for politicians and supporters to anonymously donate to organizations through DonorsTrust.
<br><hr>
In response to you, I would say “yeah you’re right, but are you surprised?” The overwhelming feeling of frustration is nothing new, though it was ignited through this documentary. Have you done the reading yet? Now that is what I call frustrating. In addition, when looking at the overly polarized nation, I was reminded of the lecture video from week 1. Professor Kiltner said our job is to vote and that is so accurate. We need to start paying attention to not what the candidates are saying, but really who is telling them to say that. As we saw in the documentary, large fossil fuel companies are sponsoring congress and scientists. “If you pay scientists enough money, they’ll find what you you want.” That was a quote I did not like to hear. 
<br><br>

I was also surprised when the evidence for skeptics came from Lord Monckton, though he has zero background in science. While this is disappointing, I would consider myself a hypocrite, in that I would listen to literally anything Leonardo Di Caprio said, though his background is not in science either (I know I’m not the only one).
<br><br>

LOL at the global warming vs. climate change comment. It was so irritating throughout the whole film. I personally have got to stop referring to the decline of fricking earth as global warming. I didn’t realize how naïve and stupid that sounded until this video. Will not happen any further. My apologies.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with the comment above on feeling complete frustration while watching “A Climate of Doubt.” I think its truly sad that this debate on whether you deny climate change or think that human activity is causing climate change, is turning into a political debate. First of all, this should not even be a debate. I could not believe in the fact that businesses will do anything for the benefit of their company’s money even if it involves going against something they believe in. The fact that the businesses that were most harmed by any climate change legislation, fossil fuel businesses, were allowed to spend as much money on trying to make people doubt climate change is truly mind-blowing and ultimately saddening. This is just feeding doubt into the minds of many people which is exactly what our world does not need. Politicians and scientists are being framed into believing false accusations. This video is just one of the many films, articles, or even books that are out there and that challenge the consensus and make climate change seem like one of many theories, which is again frightening. 
<br><br>

It's unfortunate how they mentioned that even well-known politicians are now changing their mind due to these brought about theories. They mentioned how politicians like Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich who at first believed climate change was a serious issue and needed attention now have doubts about climate change. Big influencers such as these politicians being influenced can cause great harm because they will then influence the society and create more doubts.

<br><hr>

I also felt frustrated watching the documentary because the documentary showcased the group of people, climate change skeptics, who are going to cost the rest of humanity the planet due to their delusion that climate change is a hoax. The people who were interviewed for the documentary were very Republican and had many supporters (or donators) who are highly involved in the fossil fuel industry such as the Koch Brothers. Most of the people involved with climate skeptics are wealthy men who have authority over crude oil and gasoline companies and have no scientific background knowledge. It’s frustrating to be reminded constantly while learning about the climate crisis that solutions to reverse climate change are in the hands of politicians who feel as if the earth dying is not the greatest issue out there while the "younger" progressive politicians work to bring positive changes to the earth.


<br><hr>
I completely agree, all I could think about when watching “A Climate of Doubt” was how frustrated I was. It's almost unfathomable to see many of those who have been placed in such prominent political positions, fail in acting in the best interests of their constituents, their primary duty. Instead of acting in the interests of their own people, these individuals continue to disregard the safety and future of their peers in place of personal interests and political leverage. “Are you kidding?”, is definitely the response that so many of us had watching Myron Ebell’s empty and weak response to being asked if his skepticism about the climate crisis were to end up being wrong. It is also very worrisome to recognize how much more politically polarized our country has become almost 8 years since Frontline released the documentary, undoubtedly resulting in more division and separation between the two groups on each side of the climate crisis debate. The more divided we are, the farther away we are from implementing any significant and wide-impacting decisions/legislation that will ensure the safety and survival of our future generations, mirroring your point about how “Unfortunately this divide politicizes issues that shouldn't be political issues, but human issues (such as climate change)”. It is alarming to witness skeptics deny a 97% consensus advocating for a climate crisis, even though all of those within the consensus are professionals in their fields, with many different political backgrounds. Lastly, what is most alarming is that most of these politicians do not even care about the issues at hand, let alone coming to any understanding of the situation, instead, they hope to cause enough confusion and divide that voters are swayed, and their roles are secured.

<br><hr>
I felt that same sense of fustration that you described. What was most frustrating for me was Myron Ebell's "I would be sorry," response when he was asked what he would do if climate deniers were wrong. To me, it seemed like he didn't care about the severity of the situation. It really made evident how climate change has become a political issue, only adding to the frustration. This documentary also showed the power these professional contrarians have over the public. It's troubling to think about how my own views on various things may have been altered or affected by these people who's job is to present such misinformation. I'd like to think my views wouldn't be too drastically affected, yet even with what I've learned through this class, our reading for this week, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming," made me question what was real. Although I saw through their arguments, what if I didn't for something else? What's even scarier, is who's backing these lifetime contrarians. The fossil fuels interests with all their wealth, only make it worse. When I heard that Fred Singer was also apart of the campaigns denying the impact of second hand smoke and  the depletion of ozone amongst other things, I was disgusted. I was disgusted that someone like that could have such an impact despite being wrong various times. It's frustrating how even when he's wrong, he is still able to convince a great deal of people.
<br><br>

Overall this video added to my frustration, yet it made me realize the power some people  have to politicize an issue.


<br><hr>
I relate very much to your frustration, many times when I hear about injustices as well as ignorances of people damaging another group makes me feel very frustrated and angry. Much of these climate change deniers do just that, they take advantage of groups of people who aren't that much educated and make them believe a complete lie. Not only do they tell lies but they do it at the cost of hurting future generations purposefully. They do their best to ignore the hard core facts and truths that surround climate change because they won't be affected by it and their younger family members are probably well off economically that they won't feel the initial impacts so greatly. The sad truth is that many of the world's population won't have that privilege, they won't have the economic ability to move to another country with ease because their islands are becoming submerged, or being able to escape famine because of crop failure due to droughts. I share in your anger that these climate change deniers are just allowed to spread just falls statements and try their best to convince the public of their lies. The truth is our world is changing drastically and it appears that humans have no self control or even care to help stop this destroying and recklessly accelerating our own human extinction. Eventually even the rich will feel the consequences of this human induced increase in carbon, of the effects of acidifying our oceans and the effects of eliminating clean breathable air for all of life.

<br><hr>

The first feeling that got to me was frustration as well when watching "A Climate of Doubt. It is mind-boggling that the political system and others such as big fossil fuel companies do not care about their kids, let alone even think about all of the other people in the world this is affecting. There is a split between the young generation and older generation of humans where the younger ones actually try to establish their pro views of global warming. As for the older generation, which compose of politicians and people who run large companies, they DO NOT CARE. This is the most heartbreaking part of climate change to me because even with evidence and proof, they will not move a muscle for this matter. The deniers are just as bad as people who spread false information for power.

  After watching this video it really opened my eyes about how the climate crisis is a political issue when it absolutely shouldn’t. I’m extremely angry with our political system because Republicans are bought out by fossil fuel interests and openly deny climate change. At one point in time they supported climate change and our efforts to stop it; it was once a bipartisan issue and now it is extremely polarized. Republicans dispute the science because they are afraid of what lobbyists and fossil fuel interests will do. This documentary showed me how capitalism and the free market heavily influence our democracy. The people with the money always win and I feel helpless. How are we supposed to start change when there are billions of dollars being invested in the other direction, trying to discredit us. I’m so angry, I don't think I can be friends with republicans because of how they support officials that openly deny climate change. They are hurting us. It also makes me so angry that people believe these “scientists” that argue against climate change. How can people believe them? I’m sorry to say but these people are so ignorant. They will feel the damages and destruction by climate change and I will not pity them for it was they supported and voted for.

The climate of doubt discusses how corrupt individuals spread misinformation propaganda information. I was especially surprised that such a large group of "scientists" thought climate change wasn't a real thing. Until I realized all it took to qualify was a bachelor's degree. Also, the scientists selected weren't well versed in the climate crisis; in fact, most had never studied it.  
<br><br>
I was surprised about the email requests and how invasive the climate deniers were beeing taking after the climate gate. They were going to use something in the emails to embarrass some of the climate scientists. FOA requests are an exciting part of what climate activists have to deal with.  
<br><br>

I think it's a terrible flaw that members of congress don't want to answer questions about global warming. The republicans seem just to dodge the question.


<br><Hr>
I completely agree with your comment. There should be no reason why the climate crisis is being dictated by politics rather than science. In 2008, when the climate crisis was a hot topic, even Republican politicians like Mitt Romney and John McCain emphasized the need to take action because of global warming. However, Republicans nowadays are being funded by large fossil fuel companies, and they continuously deny it. It’s very sad to see this decline of support for climate change in our political world during a time when we need their support the most. Action needs to take place, and those with power need to help make it happen. The fact that many politicians say that there’s no detrimental impacts of CO2 on our environment, rather CO2 is just a part of plant life, is crazy. The global temperature is rising, and people need to stop “going down the up escalator.” Change needs to happen now, and “A Climate of Doubt” really shows how much progress needs to be made, especially in our political world.
<br><Hr>
I, too, share this frustration you have with the politicians that put their own interests above those of the planet. I wasn’t fully aware of the extent of this issue before watching the film. It amazes me how these selfish people are not trying to convince all of the public that climate change doesn’t exist, as would be true if they genuinely believed it wasn’t and felt they were doing the right thing for the people, but they are only interested in swaying enough people to disbelieve to place enough doubt in the minds of the public that will stump the progress of the climate initiative. This tactic is much more evil, as it shows they are simply interested in protecting their own assets and status, even at the expense of the rest of the world. It is also interesting to me that this issue is so politicized, and because of this characteristic, that politicians are still allowed to receive monetary donations from fossil fuel companies. It seems like a direct and obvious conflict of interest that should not be allowed to exist in a fair political system. I share your confusion about how change is ever expected to arise with such political disparity, and this is a very hopeless and defeating thought, as agreement and compromise do not seem likely.

<br><Hr>
 You bring up a good point about how congress is still allowed to take donations fromn fossil fuel interests. I too think it is a conflict of interest and needs to stop. It really isn't fair

  I enjoyed watching this film because it did a good job at displaying both views on climate change. I was shocked to see how easy it was to manipulate information to get your argument across. With facts such as 97% of scientist proved that climate change is human induced getting so easily manipulate to discredit climate change is worrisome.  It is alarming how in four years, the number of Americans who agreed that climate change was man-made dropped by 50%. 
<br><Hr>
After watching this film, I found myself feeling angry how people with power and money are took opportunities to fight against climate change instead of helping the situation. I did not know that the 2008 recession was a reason that led to people to doubt climate change. Skeptics used the cap and trade bill that was proposed to help with human impact on climate change to further people’s uncertainties. By claiming that the cap and trade bill would lead to higher taxes, loss of jobs, and a loss of freedom, many people felt that the US could not pass the build. If the recession did not happen During the recession, many people were worried about the economic stability of the United States so they agreed that the nation was not economically stable enough to pass the bill. I did not think that economics could factor on how people felt about climate change.
<br><Hr>
It was interesting to hear how the climate change debate was described as a battle of the "urban bi-coastal elite" vs "the heartland”. Growing up in California, everyone that I know is environmentally conscious. It is interesting to see people denying climate change and not being concerned about it. It makes me feel concerned for the future of our country with seeing how little of the country actually cares about climate change. It is worrisome to see many politicians choose to ignore the situation or choose to completely ignore it. I hope as time goes on, politicians could use their influence to help bring a proper solution on how to deal with climate change.

I found it incredibly frustrating to watch the film “A Climate of Doubt” for the same reasons you were shocked to find out how easily it is for these powerful skeptics to manipulate the population into believing that climate change is a hoax. I just can't seem to understand how Americans are so easily persuaded with false information coming from the white man. This just goes to show how powerful the white man is over civilians; this spread of misleading information is what continues to let them have this power because they realize how gullible society can be and that they will continue to support certain politicians as long as they are told what they want to hear. When you mentioned that you very angry how people with “power and money took opportunities to fight against climate change instead of helping the situation,” I too felt 100% the same; a flood of anger mixed with lots of confusion. It can't seem to get through my head that there are people out there who actually doubt climate change. I'm always questioning whether these skeptics actually believe climate change is a hoax or is there something else behind it, but if so, what can it be? Makes me very concerned for our future because of the amount of skeptics that are out there and the amount of our population who are believing these skeptics. This just goes to show that something needs to be done with our education system for a change to occur because if not, everyone will continue to ignore the mess and it will just be a repeated cycle for the younger generation.

  The documentary "A Climate of Doubt" really showed how people are willing to be ignorant and blind to data for money and fame. Personally, I think that the deniers, in their sub-conscious mind do believe in man-made climate change, yet chose not to because as Ken put it, they want to believe that they have 100 dollars in the bank, not $12. Thus, these people then go to their Denier's club, change the data of the climate (data that indicates the rising temperature of the climate, can be altered to make it look like the climate is cooling), or whatever they have to do to justify to themselves that they are right. Even when indisputable evidence is stacked against them (the vast majority of the National Academy of Science), they resort to tactics such as the Oregon Petition, which is not very credible because the only requirement to join the club is a Batchelor of Science Degree. Because this group of people exists and amplify their beliefs to the public,  government officials can not ignore their constituents if they want to be elected or reelected. Bob Inglis, an incumbent Republican, lost his primary by a landslide when people realized he supported climate change. Other government officials are also scared of this, and thus try their best not to state their opinion on the matter in fear of losing support. It is an endless cycle, and nothing will ever get done like this. It is precisely what the fossil fuel industries want.

I agree with what you had to say, I wish I could say I was shocked by how many people were able to look the other way in the documentary “A Climante of Doubt,” but unfortunately it isn’t shocking whatsoever because human kind is very selfish and willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead sometimes. In this case doing so punishes our planet in the process. I find it very discouraging that there is so much false information out there, and the only thing worse than that false information being out there is that this information is so easily accessible. Which means so many people are seeing/reading these things and being improperly educated. This sets a chain reaction because once one person is misinformed they will go on to spread that information to the people around them. This film made climate change seem like a political issue which I found very irritating because it should not be considered that. It is an issue for everyone on Earth, it is not going to just affect liberals or conservatives it affects EVERYONE. The moment people stop acting like some of us won’t be affected is when we can start making changes and fixing our past mistakes.

It is really disappointing to think about how greedy and selfish an industry or individual can be, especially when it comes to the future of our planet. It is hard to believe that even with all the tangible evidence and scientific reasoning that supports human caused climate change, people still believe it's a myth. This is all driven by money and power which to me is much less important than the state of our planet and its future. When the film showed how these climate deniers can easily go in and make the temperature of the planet look like it has cooled over the years, I was surprised to learn that and disappointed to find that people will actually go to that extent. These deniers are likely not actual deniers, they are just pretending to be and are trying to use their power and money to brainwash the rest of the world. I found it interesting and somewhat ironic that Christopher Monckton, an active climate denier, even admitted to not having any scientific background whatsoever. Another climate denier, Fred Singer, didn’t believe humans were depleting ozone, creating acid rain, and criticized the theories on second hand smoking. It is crazy to think that a good amount of people still listen to individuals like Monckton and Singer even when there are so many reasons not to. 
 <br><br>
 I also found it really interesting that when Bob Inglis, a very conservative republican, spoke out about how he believed in climate change he didn’t get reelected as a republican nominee. I like how you described it as an endless cycle because that is really how it feels right now. We are stuck in a society that depends on fossil fuels  and we can’t get out of it because of the individuals we have in government who are supported by the fossil fuel industries. We need to find a way to break this ugly cycle and vote for people who care about the future of our planet and the generations to come.

  After watching the film, A Climate of Doubt, I was astounded to see just how political the issue of climate change is. Nearly every person that was interviewed in the documentary made the distinction that conservative republicans deny climate change and those that are more left leaning or who identify as democrats fully believe in it. For example, before 2011, many republicans such as Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are seen on television admitting that climate change is an issue caused by humans that needs to be addressed. However, in the year leading up to the 2012 presidential election, these same two political figures are seen on tv, this time recanting their previous statements and siding with climate change deniers. It can be inferred that this change occurred simply because these republican politicians wanted to garner more political support from those who deny climate change is currently happening. Even President Obama became less heavy handed on the issue in hopes of gaining support from swing voters. It is unacceptable that this very real issue is being treated as a tool to win elections, when the consequences are becoming more severe, frequent and devastating.
 <br><br>

Additionally, I was shocked to see how such a small group of scientists and pseudo-experts on climate change continue to deny the climate crisis simply because they are supported by the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry. They host these conventions that manipulate Americans into thinking that climate change is a hoax. Those who do not specialize in climate science claim to be experts in order to dissuade a large amount of the American population. Furthermore, they claim that the 97-8% of CLIMATE scientists who agree that climate change is happening are wrong and that they are somehow seeing something that these actual experts are not. It is wrong and creates fuel for politicians who continue to make climate change a political issue. Their immorally motivated manipulation is causing a dangerous divide with the American people and our politicians.

I agree that it is totally disappointing and unsettling to realize just how much the issue of climate change divides our nation. As stated in the film, global warming is based on politics and not science, which is wrong on so many levels. Hearing that political figures have voiced their opinions on climate change, and then gone back on them later in order to gain public support is extremely concerning. I understand why someone would say what the public wants to hear for the sake of getting elected into office, but for something as serious and urgent as the climate crisis there really is no excuse. I would assume that many conservative politicians do believe in climate change, but just do not admit it out of fear of losing public approval. I am not sure which is harder for me to fathom: an educated and elected official not believing 97% of scientists and catastrophic evidence or one who does understand the severity of climate change but intentionally discredits it in order to stay in office.
 <br><br>

Regarding your next point of 97-8% of climate scientists agreeing that climate change is really happening (and really quickly and really dangerously), I think that a question in the film about that really hit me… “Do you think this will ever be settled scientifically if 97% consensus doesn’t settle it for you?” Honestly, if that huge of a majority does not convince everyone, then I do not think 99 or even 100% of scientists on board would settle the debate. Even if every single scientist were on the same page, there would still be fossil fuel companies paying trusted (but not trustworthy) politicians to discredit the scientists’ findings. Unfortunately, the public hear more from politicians and are more likely to believe them over these unnamed scientists. I think the way to convince everyone that the climate crisis is real and needs urgent attention is going to have to be in a way separate from the science argument. If 97% doesn’t do it, we need to find a new way.

  After watching the movie, I would argue that the most outspoken advocates against climate change centered policy have vested interests elsewhere. Whether it be re-election, money, or job security, most of the information that is spread to counter Climate change does not have to do with the climate science itself. Politicizing Climate Change is dangerous because when it enters a Left vs Right debate, nothing will get done and people will feel the need to compromise, which we don't have time for
      <br><br>
  Another thing I found frustrating was the fact that the “scientific studies” that the Hartman Institute was pushing along with other denier groups, were obviously biased and choosing specific data sets to assist their argument. This directly contradicts their arguments in Why Scientists Disagree on Global Warming in which the Hartman Institute claims that unbiased studies should not be published. 
     <br><br>
   Education is the best way to combat this issue. When people are educated and realize the severity of the situation, it reflects in the policies passed in Washington. We as a country need to depoliticize Climate Change and pass policies for the protection of the planet.

I wholeheartedly agree with the points you've made in your comment. I also agree that education is the most important/best way to combat this issue. The government represents its constituents and will vote to their desires, if we educate the populace, we change the government. Thus action can be enacted, and our planet can be saved.

Watching Ken’s video as well as the documentary shed light on the history of climate change as a political issue in the United States. For the most part, while I had considered myself well versed in the science behind climate change, I had been unaware of the political history behind it. A point Ken brought up which I feel is becoming increasingly ever so important is media corruption and disinformation. The media and its publications are no longer impartial and bias free, nearly every platform contains some form of skew and/or hidden motive. I found the parallel that Ken drew between the tobacco industry propaganda and climate change propaganda to be apt. In fact, in the last video the group that Ken mentioned -- the Heartland Institute-- also denied tobacco’s negative impacts on health. 
     <br><br>

Watching parts of the documentary felt like seeing a satire video on the United States. Seeing the protests against cap and trade and the U.S.A chants in the crowd felt like something straight off of a Key and Peele skit. Watching this documentary was frustrating. Seeing institutions like the Heartland Institute cherry pick data and twist it into complete misrepresentation of the facts was appalling. Reading Monday’s reading in which the Oregon petition is purported as a group of scientists, and then finding out that the signers of the petition merely needed to have a Bachelor's degree was disappointing--especially considering that they denounced the 97% statistic as not constituting primarily Ph.D holders. ⅔’s of the signers did not have a Ph.D, and of that 66%, not all of them have a background in climate change. The American Tradition Institute method of deterring scientists through attempting to find “embarrassing” emails is quite frankly impressive in a morbid sort of way. I found it eye opening to see someone as staunchly conservative as former Senator Inglis fail to achieve reelection due to his stance on climate change, especially by such a huge margin. An incumbent losing a primary election like that is … sort of unfathomable to me given everything I’ve learned about civics as well as have experienced as a voter. The anonymous funding from sources like Donor trust and others are an affront to our democracy.
<br><hr>
 I fully agree with the point you made of the comparison to the Tobacco industry. Greedy corporations will do anything to keep their profits, even at the expense of their consumers. In the case of the climate change debate, we are compromising the safety of future generations, in order to gain a few extra dollars today. What is especially troubling is that this also turns into an environmental justice issue. The richest people will be able to avoid the immediate effects of climate change, and simultaneously take advantage of the less educated, poorer nations.
<br><hr>
I agree that it is dangerous to politicize climate change and that we need to be educated more on the issue in order to execute solutions. After watching the film I thought that the arguments made by the anti climate change people were not strong as you noted they used data to benefit their argument. While I understand that some people might be susceptible to believing the other side I think educating them would help them understand that climate change is real. While watching the film I also couldn’t help but wonder why anyone would oppose living a more sustainable life. Although I know it is largely to do with money I don’t understand how the disbelievers of climate change can say that the government and other scientists are lying about climate change being real.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. This documentary was very interesting to me because it showed what the skeptics believed to be true. What you said about people being more interested in money and re-election is can still be seen in our society today almost 10 years later and goes far beyond just global warming.
     <br><br>


I think the thing I found most interesting was when the senator related it to children and doctors asking people if they would trust the idea of 98 doctors, or if they would trust the other 2. When I listen to the people who don't believe in global warming, I sometimes wonder if they realize how much they contradict themselves. Multiple times they would say they agree with facts and charts they had read suggesting that global warming wasn't happening but when asked about real statistics they weren't as sure.
     <br><br>


Lastly, I would like to see these same people interviewed today with all the new info we have and still try to say that there is not a climate crisis. It is sad to see that an issue that affects us all is being separated into a political argument.

I strongly agree with what you said about how “politicizing climate change is dangerous”. It’s unfortunate that our government is so deeply divided and refuses to come together on an issue that will affect all people, no matter left or right. I think this speaks a lot about the people we are electing into our government, even starting with state governments. What I found most impactful about this movie was towards the end when they began to talk about how the issue of climate change is slowly falling off the policy radar. At the height of Obama’s presidency, the issue of climate change was a huge focusing point for him and he was calling for legislation to be passed up that instituted cap and trade policies. While this was critiqued, it’s not what stopped him from pressing climate change as a huge issue. In 2008, when the economy started to crash, Americans were sent into a panic and big corporations along with climate deniers saw this as an opportunity to sway public opinion in their favor. Corrupt politicians who were greedy to be reelected and stake their hold on power were then also influenced by big corporations who had gotten a hold on their constituents. Slowly but surely, climate change began to fall off our government's radar. If anything, this just shows how dangerous it is that we have left the fate of our planet in the hands of policymakers who only think in the then and now rather than the future.

One story in the film that really stood out to me was about Bob Inglis, a bleeding heart republican representative for South Carolina. At the time, he held the popular vote of his constituents who favored the conservative right side. When asked if he believed the statistic that 97% of scientists believe that human-caused climate change is real and dangerous, he said that he did believe there was a near consensus on climate change. Due to this, he did not get reelected in the next election despite seeing eye to eye with his constituents on nearly every other issue. This single issue practically ended his career as a politician. It makes me outraged that his agreeance with the statistic basically vilified him. When things like this happen, it makes it hard to blame politicians for so easily switching sides on an issue. With this in mind, can we really rely on them to stick to a hard pressing agenda of slowing climate change?

  This was a very well done feature that shows the struggle between different groups over the topic of climate change and the steps needed to combat it. While we see how the majority of the people are in agreement about the danger of this process, we also are exposed to the people who either doubt the science or simply do not care, and the immense influence they can have on people. While some simply do not buy in to the notion that our environment is changing, many have other agendas, such as money or business, that is in direct conflict with the laws in place to reduce pollution and emissions. These people are powerful and have platforms to spread misinformation and doubt, and they have a decent amount of support from the public. It is concerning to see the nonchalant attitudes of some people regarding this issue, as every day we waste doing nothing to correct this issue makes the chance of recovery that much smaller. I hope as more and more evidence comes out, people will be able to ignore their differences and work together to save this planet.

I agree with your statement that “this was a very well done feature that shows the struggle between different groups over the topic of climate change and the steps needed to combat it.” We see different people express different views in this film. In your comment, you analyze people’s actions and summarize why they support anthropogenic climate change theory. “Some simply do not buy in to the notion that our environment is changing.” Also, people who hold power and have influence on the public may convey incorrect information for their own interests, such as money and business. The film really astonishes me because I see so many attitudes from people toward only one issue. I think we need to change. Something must be done. Just like you wish in your comment, “as more and more evidence comes out, people will be able to ignore their differences and work together to save this planet.”

This comment was very well done. It summarizes many of the main takeaways from the video very effectively. One idea that was brought up in this comment is that many people/groups have agendas that are in conflict with policies to fight climate change. I think that this might be the most important idea in the film. Americans have to know that these corporation-based advocacy groups trying to diminish our perception of climate change as an issue are doing so with agendas that have no relation to climate change. American people listen to what they are told, usually without finding anything about the source. This is a major problem and for many decades, it has deeply eroded attempts to fight climate change. One other big idea that I wanted to bring up from the film is that to many Americans, climate change was/is seen as a threat to future generations and not current ones. Add on the economic hardship of recent years and Americans have been largely unwilling to support a carbon tax or other policies to reduce pollution and emissions.

In response to you, I took away a lot of the information you did from the documentary as well. Climate of Doubt is incredibly frustrating as it shows a large group of people working against climate scientists, activists and its “believers” by having little or misinformation to dispute the issue. The film partly aims towards exposing or at least have us question the people, companies and organization who are behind this anti-climate change movement and is probably the most important part of the issue of the film. I think that as consumers it is our right to know where it is our money is going to, I don’t mean what product or service we are purchasing but how the money we generate for companies and large organizations is spent. This is why I was so bothered when I learned about “DonorsTrust” and their ability to take in anonymous contributions and fund anti-progressive movements like these. It seems to be yet another layer of “hiding” for people and groups who have the resources to push doubt over the issue without being held accountable.

I agree that we aren’t doing much to combat this issue and would love to continue to learn more about how it is we can all actually get on the same page of understanding climate change to be a problem. I feel we must reach a majority consensus before/if we’re even able to push towards more sustainable actions to better the planet. It’s just so annoying to read about all the methods these people are able to relay their information to insight doubt, the two that struck me the most was that of warping statistics by nitpicking the recorded temperatures throughout history and that of some people having absolutely what we should know to be zero credibility, a platform from which they could misinform so many others.
